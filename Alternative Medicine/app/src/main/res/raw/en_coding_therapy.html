<h1>Coding (therapy)</h1><p><b>Coding</b> (also known as the <b>Dovzhenko method</b>) is a catch-all term for various Russian alternative therapeutic methods used to treat addictions, in which the therapist attempts to scare patients into abstinence from a substance they are addicted to by convincing them that they will be harmed or killed if they use it again. Each method involves the therapist pretending to insert a &quot;code&quot; into patients&apos; brains that will ostensibly provoke a strong adverse reaction should it come into contact with the addictive substance. The methods use a combination of theatrics, hypnosis, placebos, and drugs with temporary adverse effects to instill the erroneous beliefs. Therapists may pretend to &quot;code&quot; patients for a fixed length of time, such as five years.</p>
<p>Coding was created by Alexander Dovzhenko, a psychiatrist in the former Soviet Union. It has been widely used to treat alcohol addiction in Russia, but 16 percent of Russian narcologists also report using it in their practices.</p>

<p>In the case of alcohol addiction, the procedure may be carried out with a drug that temporarily affects the respiratory system when mixed with alcohol, administered under hypnosis. The therapist gives patients the drug, then allows them a small amount of alcohol, which triggers an adverse reaction and makes them erroneously believe that the therapy has had a long-term effect. Another method involves the therapist giving patients hypnotic suggestions during a head massage, with the message that alcohol will cause blindness or paralysis.</p>
<p>In one method, the therapist numbs patients&apos; mouths with local anaesthetic, then places electrodes with a very weak current into their mouths. This is to make patients believe that the &quot;nerve points&quot; in their mouth are being &quot;manipulated&quot; and that it is no longer safe for them to drink alcohol. A further method involves the therapist using a special helmet to persuade patients that the therapist&apos;s suggestions are controlling their minds. Typically, therapists will also make patients sign a disclaimer, supposedly absolving the therapist of any responsibility should the patient use the addictive substance and suffer ill effects or die.</p>
