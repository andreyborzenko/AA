<h1>Electromagnetic therapy (alternative medicine)</h1>

<p><b>Electromagnetic therapy</b> is a pseudoscientific form of alternative medicine which claims to treat disease by applying electromagnetic radiation to the body. There is no scientific evidence that non-medically approved electromagnetic therapy is effective in treating any condition. Practitioners claim that these methods can treat a wide range of ailments, including ulcers, headaches, burns, chronic pain, nerve disorders, spinal cord injuries, diabetes, gum infections, asthma, bronchitis, arthritis, cerebral palsy, heart disease and cancer.</p>
<p>Even though some of the early works in bioelectromagnetics are being successfully applied in clinical medicine, there is no relationship between alternative devices or methods which use externally applied electrical forces and the use of electromagnetic energy in mainstream medicine.</p>





<p>Despite the lack of scientific evidence, low frequency electromagnetic therapy has been proposed by practitioners of alternative medicine for a variety of purposes, including cell growth promotion, pain reduction, improved blood circulation, bone repair, increased wound healing, sedative effects, enhanced sleep, and arthritic relief.</p>
<p>Some proponents of electromagnetic therapy believe that &quot;harmful electromagnetic fields&quot; might &quot;disrupt the body&apos;s chemical makeup resulting in disease and illness.&quot; The Moore Cancer Center of the University of California, San Diego Medical Center offers alternative therapies for cancer patients. However, it clearly states on its website that to their knowledge &quot;there is no scientific evidence available that any electromagnetic therapies work.&quot;</p>

<p>The American Cancer Society says that &quot;relying on electromagnetic treatment alone and avoiding conventional medical care may have serious health consequences.&quot; In some cases the devices may be ineffective and harmful. A 2012-2013 systematic review by the Cochrane Library found no evidence that electromagnetic therapy was useful in healing pressure ulcers or venous stasis ulcers.</p>
