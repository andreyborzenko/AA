<h1>Vipassan&#x101;</h1>


<p><b>Vipassan&#x101;</b> (P&#x101;li) or <b>vipa&#x15B;yan&#x101;</b> (Sanskrit: ; Myanmar: &#x101D;&#x102D;&#x1015;&#x103F;&#x1014;&#x102C;; Sinhalese: ; Chinese:  <i>gu&#x101;n</i>; Standard Tibetan: , <i>lhaktong</i>; Wyl. <i>lhag mthong</i>) in the Buddhist tradition means insight into the true nature of reality, namely as the Three marks of existence: impermanence, suffering or unsatisfactoriness, and the realisation of non-self. Presectarian Buddhism emphasized the practice of Dhyana, but early in the history of Buddhism Vipassan&#x101; gained a prominent place in the teachings.</p>
<p><b>Vipassan&#x101; meditation</b> has been reintroduced in the Theravada-tradition by Ledi Sayadaw and Mogok Sayadaw and popularized by Mahasi Sayadaw, S. N. Goenka, and the Vipassana movement,  in which mindfulness of breathing and of thoughts, feelings and actions are being used to gain insight into the true nature of reality. Due to the popularity of Vipassan&#x101;-meditation, the mindfulness of breathing has gained further popularity in the west as mindfulness.</p>





<p><i>Vipassan&#x101;</i> is a Pali word from the Sanskrit prefix &quot;vi-&quot; and verbal root pa&#x15B;. It is often translated as <i>&quot;insight&quot;</i> or <i>&quot;clear-seeing,&quot;</i> though, the &quot;in-&quot; prefix may be misleading; &quot;vi&quot; in Indo-Aryan languages is equivalent to the Latin &quot;dis.&quot; The &quot;vi&quot; in vipassan&#x101; may then mean to see into, see through or to see &apos;in a special way.&apos; Alternatively, the &quot;vi&quot; can function as an intensive, and thus vipassan&#x101; may mean &quot;seeing deeply.&quot;</p>
<p>A synonym for &quot;Vipassan&#x101;&quot; is <i>paccakkha</i> (P&#x101;li; Sanskrit: <i></i>), &quot;before the eyes,&quot; which refers to direct experiential perception. Thus, the type of seeing denoted by &quot;vipassan&#x101;&quot; is that of direct perception, as opposed to knowledge derived from reasoning or argument.</p>
<p>In Tibetan, <i>vipa&#x15B;yan&#x101;</i> is <i>lhagthong</i> (wylie: <i>lhag mthong</i>). The term &quot;<i>lhag</i>&quot; means &quot;higher&quot;, &quot;superior&quot;, &quot;greater&quot;; the term &quot;<i>thong</i>&quot; is &quot;view&quot; or &quot;to see&quot;. So together, <i>lhagthong</i> may be rendered into English as &quot;superior seeing&quot;, &quot;great vision&quot; or &quot;supreme wisdom.&quot; This may be interpreted as a &quot;superior manner of seeing&quot;, and also as &quot;seeing that which is the essential nature.&quot; Its nature is a lucidity&#x2014;a clarity of mind.</p>
<p>Henepola Gunaratana defined Vipassan&#x101; as:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>Looking into something with clarity and precision, seeing each component as distinct and separate, and piercing all the way through so as to perceive the most fundamental reality of that thing&quot;</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Origins">Origins</span></h3>
<p>According to Richard Gombrich a development took place in early Buddhism resulting in a change in doctrine, which considered <i>prajna</i> to be an alternative means to &quot;enlightenment&quot;. The suttas contain traces of ancient debates between Mahayana and Theravada schools in the interpretation of the teachings and the development of insight. In the sutta pitaka the term &quot;vipassan&#x101;&quot; is hardly mentioned, while they frequently mention jhana as the meditative practice to be undertaken.</p>
<p>According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, <i>dhy&#x101;na</i> itself constituted the original &quot;liberating practice&quot;. Vetter further argues that the eightfold path constitutes a body of practices which prepare one, and lead up to, the practice of <i>dhyana</i>. Norman notes that &quot;the Buddha&apos;s way to release [...] was by means of meditative practices.&quot; Out of these debates developed the idea that bare insight suffices to reach liberation, by discerning the Three marks (qualities) of (human) existence (tilakkhana), namely dukkha (suffering), anatta (non-self) and anicca (impermanence).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sudden_insight">Sudden insight</span></h3>
<p>The Sthavirav&#x101;da, one of the early Buddhist schools from which the Theravada-tradition originates, emphasized sudden insight:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>In the Sthaviravada [...] progress in understanding comes all at once, &apos;insight&apos; (<i>abhisamaya</i>) does not come &apos;gradually&apos; (successively - <i>anapurva</i>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Mahasanghika, another one of the early Buddhist schools, had the doctrine of <i>ekaksana-citt</i>, &quot;according to which a Buddha knows everything in a single thought-instant&quot;. This process however, meant to apply only to the Buddha and Peccaka buddhas. Lay people may have to experience various levels of insights to become fully enlightened.</p>
<p>The Mahayana-tradition emphasizes prajna, insight into sunyata, dharmata, the two truths doctrine, clarity and emptiness, or bliss and emptiness:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>[T]he very title of a large corpus of early Mahayana literature, the <i>Prajnaparamita</i>, shows that to some extent the historian may extrapolate the trend to extol insight, <i>prajna</i>, at the expense of dispassion, <i>viraga</i>, the control of the emotions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Theravada and Mahayana are commonly understood as different streams of Buddhism, their practice however, may reflect emphasis on insight as a common denominator:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>In practice and understanding Zen is actually very close to the Theravada Forest Tradition even though its language and teachings are heavily influenced by Taoism and Confucianism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The emphasis on insight is discernible in the emphasis in Ch&#xE1;n on sudden insight, though in the Ch&#xE1;n-tradition this insight is to be followed by gradual cultivation.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Relation_with_samatha">Relation with samatha</span></h3>

<p>In the Theravada-tradition, but also in Tibetan Buddhism, two types of meditation Buddhist practices are being followed, namely samatha (P&#x101;li; Sanskrit: <i>&#x15B;amatha</i>; &quot;calm&quot;) and vipassana (insight). Samatha is a primary meditation aimed at calming the mind, and it is also being used in other Indian traditions, notably Raja yoga.</p>
<p>Contemporary Theravada orthodoxy regards samatha as a preparation for vipassan&#x101;, pacifying the mind and strengthening the concentration in order to allow the work of insight, which leads to liberation. In contrast, the Vipassana Movement argues that insight levels can be discerned without the need for developing samatha further due to the risks of going out of course when strong samatha is developed. For this innovation the Vipassana Movement has been criticised, especially in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Though both terms appear in the Sutta Pitaka, Gombrich and Brooks argue that the distinction as two <i>separate</i> paths originates in the earliest <i>interpretations</i> of the Sutta Pitaka, not in the suttas themselves. According to Gombrich, the distinction between vipassan&#x101; and samatha did not originate in the suttas, but in the <i>interpretation</i> of the suttas. Various traditions disagree which techniques belong to which pole.</p>


<p>Vipassan&#x101; can be cultivated by the practice that includes contemplation and introspection although primarily awareness and observation of bodily sensations. The practices may differ in the modern Buddhist traditions and non-sectarian groups according to the founder but the main objective is to develop insight. </p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Insight_in_the_Four_Noble_Truths">Insight in the Four Noble Truths</span></h4>
<p>According to the Theravada-tradition, Buddhist practices leads to insight in the Four Noble Truths, which can only be reached by practising the Noble Eightfold Path. According to Theravada tradition enlightenment or Nibbana can only be attained by discerning all Vipassana insight levels when the Eightfold Noble Path is followed ardently. This is a developmental process where various Vipassana insights are discerned and the final enlightenment may come suddenly as proposed by other schools.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Vipassan.C4.81_movement">Vipassan&#x101; movement</span></h4>

<p>The term <i>vipassana</i> became popular due to the influence of the Vipassana movement which started in the 1950s in Burma. It has come to be considered a practical solution to handle emotions in a complex society.</p>
<p>The Vipassan&#x101; Movement, also known as the Insight Meditation Movement, refers to a number of schools of modern Therav&#x101;da Buddhism, especially the Thai Forest Tradition and the &quot;New Burmese Method&quot;, which emphasize development of insight into the three marks of existence as a means to become awakened and enter the Stream.</p>
<p>The modern influences on the traditions of Sri Lanka, Burma, Laos and Thailand originating from various Therav&#x101;da teachers like Ledi sayadaw, Mogok Sayadaw who was less known to the West due to lack of International Mogok Centres, Mahasi Sayadaw, Ajahn Chah, and Dipa Ma, as well as derivatives from those traditions such as the movement led by S. N. Goenka. The Vipassan&#x101; Movement also includes contemporary American Buddhist teachers such as Joseph Goldstein, Tara Brach, Gil Fronsdal, Sharon Salzberg, and Jack Kornfield.</p>
<p>In the Vipassan&#x101; Movement, the emphasis is on the Satipatthana Sutta and the use of mindfulness to gain insight into the impermanence of the self-view.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Vipassana-meditation">Vipassana-meditation</span></h4>
<p>Vipassan&#x101;-meditation uses mindfulness of breathing, combined with the contemplation of impermanence, to gain insight into the true nature of this reality. All phenomena are investigated, and concluded to be painful and unsubstantial, without an immortal entity or self-view, and in its ever-changing and impermanent nature.</p>
<p>Mindfulness of breathing is described throughout the Sutta Pitaka. The Satipatthana Sutta describes it as going into the forest and sitting beneath a tree and then to simply watch the breath. If the breath is long, to notice that the breath is long, if the breath is short, to notice that the breath is short.</p>
<p>By observing the breath one becomes aware of the perpetual changes involved in breathing, and the arising and passing away of mindfulness. One can also be aware of and gain insight into impermanence through the observation of bodily sensations and their nature of arising and passing away.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Stages_in_the_practice">Stages in the practice</span></h4>

<p>Vipassan&#x101; jhanas are stages that describe the development of <i>vipassan&#x101;</i> meditation practice as described in modern Burmese Vipassana meditation. Mahasi Sayadaw&apos;s student Sayadaw U Pandita described the four <i>vipassan&#x101; jhanas</i> as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The meditator first explores the body/mind connection as one, nonduality; discovering three characteristics. The first jhana consists in seeing these points and in the presence of <i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicara</i>. Phenomena reveal themselves as appearing and ceasing.</li>
<li>In the second <i>jhana</i>, the practice seems effortless. <i>Vitaka</i> and <i>vicara</i> both disappear.</li>
<li>In the third <i>jhana</i>, <i>piti</i>, the joy, disappears too: there is only happiness (<i>sukha</i>) and concentration.</li>
<li>The fourth <i>jhana</i> arises, characterised by purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. The practice leads to direct knowledge. The comfort disappears because the dissolution of all phenomena is clearly visible. The practice will show every phenomenon as unstable, transient, disenchanting. The desire of freedom will take place.</li>
</ol>
<p>Eventually Vipassan&#x101;-meditation leads to insight into the impermanence of all phenomena, and thereby lead to a permanent liberation.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Vajrayana">Vajrayana</span></h4>

<p>Indian Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na Buddhism employed both deductive investigation (applying ideas <i>to</i> experience) and inductive investigation (drawing conclusions <i>from</i> direct experience) in the practice of vipa&#x15B;yan&#x101;. According to Leah Zahler, only the tradition of deductive analysis in vipa&#x15B;yan&#x101; was transmitted to Tibet in the s&#x16B;tray&#x101;na context.</p>
<p>In Tibet direct examination of moment-to-moment experience as a means of generating insight became exclusively associated with vajray&#x101;na.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Mah.C4.81mudr.C4.81_and_Dzogchen">Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101; and Dzogchen</span></h4>
<p>Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101; and Dzogchen use vipa&#x15B;yan&#x101; extensively. This includes some methods of the other traditions, but also their own specific approaches. They place a greater emphasis on meditation on symbolic images. Additionally in the Vajray&#x101;na (tantric) path, the true nature of mind is pointed out by the guru, and this serves as a direct form of insight.</p>
