<h1>Seitai</h1>
<p><b>SEITAI</b> (in Japanese kanji &#x6574;&#x4F53;) is a culture of life and health based on the simple practices of revitalizing the spontaneous movement, yuki and katsugen, supported by the knowledge about the structure of vital movement, revealed by Haruchika Noguchi (1912-1976).</p>




<p>Noguchi started his therapeutic activity at age of 12, healing diseases with the contact of his hands (shokushu). His success was so, that he was requested for attending Japan&#x2019;s Empress. However, he felt that the healing was due to the organism&#x2019;s own capacity of regaining its own vitality. Noguchi wanted to know the specific manner in which the different activities of our organism, energetic-physical, biological-biochemical and psychic-mental, are inter-related and allow us to be a unit.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of Europeanization that was being held in Japan, he looked for an answer in the millennial oriental wisdom of Chinese medicine and in the modern occidental science, but he didn&#x2019;t find it. However, his extraordinary intuition and observing capacity guided him to reveal it within the spontaneous movement:</p>
<p><i><b>Life moves in five directions and in two polarities + and -.</b></i></p>
<p>When he had ensured the tremendous value of <i>katsugen</i> and <i>yuki</i> practices on health and the accuracy of his own discovery about the structure of the movement of life, he founded the cultural activity SEITAI in the 50&#x2019;s Japan of the XXth Century.</p>
<p><b>Katsumi Mamine</b> (1944) learned SEITAI culture through a close relationship with Noguchi and has deepen on his legacy since 1972 in Barcelona (Europe). The recovery of concepts such as <i>osei</i> or <i>the spontaneous</i>, and above all, the creation of the term <b>CVP</b> (Cranium-Vertebrae-Pelvis) allow us a more precise way of exposing Noguchi&#x2019;s approach for the international human culture of the XXIst Century: both Western and Eastern cultures have thought until now that the head rules the trunk, however, <b>the head belongs to the CVP, which is actually the rectorial structure of life</b>.</p>
<p>Definitions:</p>
<p><b>CVP:</b> the CVP (Cranium-Vertebrae-Pelvis) is the maximum organization of the different cellular associations (tissues, organs and organic systems) and, in consequence, the representative of our organism.</p>
<p><b>KATSUGEN UNDO:</b> when paying attention to the movement (undo) that emerges from our organism, caused by the natural desire of restoring CVP coordination, and plainly following this spontaneous movement, we recover vitality (katsu) which has its origin (gen) in this specific coordination.</p>
<p><b>YUKI:</b> when paying attention spontaneously and intuitively with our hands to some parts of the organism, preferably on the CVP, a pleasant communication is established with another person&#x2019;s or oneself&#x2019;s sensitiveness, and by following this, one recovers its natural movement and the coordination with its CVP.</p>
<p><b>OSEI:</b> the capacity of responding or interaction with the world, in any of its 5 dimensions, through the 5 vital and universal movements: vertical, frontal, lateral, rotational and central, and with two polarities + and &#x2013;.</p>
<p><b>OSEI SQUEME:</b> how the 5 oseis structure the CVP by the interrelation of its 5 movements, its 5 cavities, its 5 big organic systems, its 5 biological functions and its 5 psychic-mental activities. The 5 oseis coordinate through the 5 regions of the osei: 2 f-e extremes, 1 lateral middle area and 2 circular intermediate areas, in the general CVP, in each kyphosis and lordosis of the vertebral column and the members.</p>
<p><b>TAIHEKI:</b> each person is born with a unique and unrepeatable combination of the 5 oseis + and &#x2013;, with a predominance of one or some of them; and of their specific motor activity, energetic-physical, organic-biological, psychic-mental.</p>
<p><b>HUMAN NATURE, A NEW UNDERSTANDING:</b> the data of the modern occidental science and the millennial oriental observation are showing by themselves how the different components and activities of our organism have been created by and for the five movements and its manifestation, in an absolute structural, functional and evolutional interrelation.</p>
<p>Master Noguchi&#x2019;s legacy is kept by his sons and disciples in the current Seitai Kyokai: .</p>
<p>In Europe, it has been developed fundamentally by Katsumi Mamine in Barcelona: .</p>
<p><b>SEITAI</b> has been spread all over the world in many different ways. Some are erroneous because it is being raised as a therapeutic activity. Other experts are spreading it with their own singularity. Nonetheless, nowadays SEITAI is definitely not well known.</p>
<p><b>SEITAI Barcelona Foundation</b> aims for spreading this activity to society and for being a common home of the diverse perspectives about this <i>culture of the spontaneous movement</i>:</p>
