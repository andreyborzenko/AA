<h1>Rebirthing (breathwork)</h1><p><b>Rebirthing-breathwork</b> is a type of breathwork invented by Leonard Orr. Orr proposed that correct breathing can cure disease and relieve pain.</p>
<p>Orr devised rebirthing therapy in the 1970s after he supposedly re-lived his own birth while in the bath. He claimed that breathing techniques could be used to purge traumatic childhood memories that had been repressed.</p>
<p>Rebirthing-breathwork is one of the practices critiqued by anti-cult experts Margaret Singer and Janja Lalich in the book Crazy Therapies: What Are They? Do They Work?. Singer and Lalich write that proponents of such &quot;bizarre&quot; practices are proud of their non-scientific approach, and that this finds favor with an irrational clientele. In 2006, a panel that consisted of over one hundred experts participated in a survey of psychological treatments considered rebirthing therapy to be discredited.</p>
