<h1>Urine therapy</h1>
<p>In alternative medicine, the term <b>urine therapy</b> or <b>urotherapy</b>, (also <b>urinotherapy</b> or <b>uropathy</b> or <b>auto-urine therapy</b>) refers to various applications of human urine for medicinal or cosmetic purposes, including drinking of one&apos;s own urine and massaging one&apos;s skin, or gums, with one&apos;s own urine. There is no scientific evidence to support its use.</p>




<p>Though urine has been used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in several traditional systems, and mentioned in some medical texts, auto-urine therapy as a system of alternative medicine was popularized by British naturopath John W. Armstrong in early 20th century. Armstrong was inspired by his family&apos;s practice of using urine to treat minor stings and toothaches, by a metaphorical reading of the Biblical Proverb 5:15 &quot;Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well&quot;, and his own experience with ill-health that he treated with a 45-day fast &quot;on nothing but urine and tap water&quot;. Starting in 1918, Armstrong prescribed urine-therapy regimens that he devised to many thousands of patients, and in 1944 he published <i>The Water of Life: A treatise on urine therapy</i>, which became a founding document of the field.</p>
<p>Armstrong&apos;s book sold widely, and in India inspired the writing of <i>Manav mootra</i> (Gujarati: Urine therapy; 1959) by Gandhian social reformer Raojibhai Manibhai Patel, and many later works. These works often reference <i>Shivambu Kalpa</i>, a treatise on the pharmaceutical value of urine, as a source of the practice in the East. They also cite passing references to properties and uses of urine in Yogic-texts such as <i>Vayavaharasutra</i> by Bhadrabahu and <i>Hatha Yoga Pradapika</i> by Svatmarama; and Ayurvedic texts such as <i>Sushruta Samhita</i>, <i>Bhava Prakasha</i> and <i>Harit</i>. However, according to medical anthropologist Joseph Atler, the practices of <i>sivambu</i> (drinking one&apos;s own urine) and <i>amaroli</i> recommended by modern Indian practitioners of urine therapy are closer to the ones propounded by Armstrong than traditional ayurveda or yoga, or even the practices described in <i>Shivambu Kalpa</i>.</p>
<p>Urine-therapy has also been with other forms of alternative medicine. For example, in her book <i>Your Own Perfect Medicine: The Incredible Proven Natural Miracle Cure that Medical Science Has Never Revealed!</i>, Martha M. Christy describes homeopathic preparations of urine and their uses, and says that they are &quot;extremely potent&quot;.</p>

<p>Urine is a by-product of the body secreted by the kidney, and cellular metabolism generates numerous by-products that require clearance from the bloodstream. An exhaustive description of the composition of human urine was prepared for NASA in 1971. Urine is an aqueous solution of greater than 95% water, with the remaining constituents, in order of decreasing concentration urea 9.3 g/L, chloride 1.87 g/L, sodium 1.17 g/L, potassium 0.750 g/L, creatinine 0.670 g/L and other dissolved ions, inorganic and organic compounds.</p>
<p>It has been claimed that Thai people have been practicing urophagia for a long time, although the Department of Thai Traditional and Alternative Medicine say there is no record of the practice.</p>
<p>There is no scientific evidence of a therapeutic use for untreated urine.</p>
<p>Urinating on jellyfish stings is a common folk remedy, however <i>Scientific American</i> reports that it may be counterproductive, as it can activate nematocysts remaining at the site of the sting, making the pain worse.</p>
<p>Urine and urea have been claimed by some practitioners to have an anti-cancer effect, and Urotherapy has been offered along with other forms of alternative therapy in some cancer clinics in Mexico. According to the American Cancer Society, &quot;available scientific evidence does not support claims that urine or urea given in any form is helpful for cancer patients&quot;.</p>
