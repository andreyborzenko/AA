<h1>Traditional Vietnamese medicine</h1>

<p><b>Traditional Vietnamese medicine</b> (Y h&#x1ECD;c C&#x1ED5; truy&#x1EC1;n Vi&#x1EC7;t Nam), also known as <b>Southern Herbology</b> (Thu&#x1ED1;c Nam) is a traditional medicine practiced by Vietnamese people. It is influenced by traditional Chinese medicine. The other traditional medicine that is also practiced in Vietnam is traditional Chinese medicine (Trung Y), also known as Northern Herbology (Thu&#x1ED1;c B&#x1EAF;c). Thu&#x1ED1;c Nam is one of two kinds of folk remedies known to villagers, the other being the traditional exercise d&#x1B0;&#x1EE1;ng sinh.</p>




<p>Traditional Vietnamese medicine differs from traditional Chinese medicine in which it relies wholly on native ingredients which are then used in their fresh state or simply dried. Vietnamese medicine typically does not require complicated decoction seen in Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>Even common herbs and vegetables like rau r&#x103;m, kinh gi&#x1EDB;i, c&#x1EA3;i c&#xFA;c, rau mu&#x1ED1;ng are used. The flowers of <i>Magnolia champaca</i>, <i>Jasminum sambac</i> are also employed for their pharmacologic properties. Animal products like silkworms are infrequently used.</p>
<p>In addition to ingested preparations, ointments and poultice are also part of the repertoire, along with steaming therapy (x&#xF4;ng h&#x1A1;i).</p>

<p>Various compendiums and treatises on traditional Vietnamese medicine include the 11-volume <i>Nam d&#x1B0;&#x1EE3;c th&#x1EA7;n hi&#x1EC7;u</i> by the 14th century physician  and <i>H&#x1EA3;i Th&#x1B0;&#x1EE3;ng y t&#xF4;ng t&#xE2;m l&#x129;nh</i> by the 18th century physician . Other pre-20th century texts include <i>Nam d&#x1B0;&#x1EE3;c ch&#x1EC9; danh truy&#x1EC1;n</i>, <i>Ti&#x1EC3;u nhi khoa di&#x1EC5;n Qu&#x1ED1;c &#xE2;m</i>.</p>

<p>Thu&#x1ED1;c Nam is usually sought for more common ailments like coughs and fevers. Smallpox, a common occurrence in traditional Vietnam also has a number of prescriptions in historic texts.</p>
