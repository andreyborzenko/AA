<h1>Universal Medicine</h1>
<p><b>Universal Medicine</b> is an alternative medicine and self proclaimed religious organisation providing &quot;esoteric healing&quot; products, music, publications, workshops and courses. None of the healing modalities are evidence-based or have been proven effective by scientific research. It is headed by its founder Serge Benhayon, a former bankrupt tennis coach from Maroubra who has no medical qualifications. The organization is principally located in Goonellabah and Wollongbar, NSW, Australia. Its UK headquarters is known as &quot;The Lighthouse&quot; and is situated in Tytherington, near Frome, Somerset, England.</p>
<p>The signature treatments practiced and taught by Universal Medicine are &quot;esoteric breast massage&quot;, &quot;esoteric healing&quot;, &quot;ovarian readings&quot;, &quot;chakra-puncture&quot;, &quot;esoteric connective tissue therapy&quot; and &quot;esoteric ovary massage&quot;. All treatments were devised by Serge Benhayon who has claimed the business grosses at least AUD$2 million a year from courses and retreats.</p>
<p>The followers of its religion, &quot;The Way of the Livingness&quot;, are known collectively as &quot;The Student Body&quot;. &quot;The Teachings&quot; are classified into meditation, self-care, nutrition, exercise, music, re-incarnation, psychological wellbeing and the esoteric, and are supported by audio, books, and online lectures. Serge Benhayon reportedly calls himself &quot;the descended master&quot; and followers believe he &quot;was the one sent from (the mythical kingdom of) Shamballa to awaken us all&quot;.</p>
<p>While Benhayon has denied engaging in unethical practices, significant evidence to the contrary has been documented.</p>





<p>Esoteric healing beliefs are based on the occult teachings of early 20th century theosophist Alice A. Bailey. Serge Benhayon has claimed to be the reincarnation of Leonardo da Vinci, as well as Alice A. Bailey, Pythagoras, Imhotep and Saint Peter. He has written that Leonardo da Vinci is a &quot;Claimed Son of God&quot; and teaches that he is connected energetically to an ancient lineage of &quot;living wisdom&quot;, and more &quot;High Initiates&quot; and Claimed Sons of God will reincarnate &quot;over and over again until each and every single human is united as one, by their true light&quot;.</p>
<p>Serge Benhayon devised Universal Medicine&apos;s healing practices based on the belief that disease is caused by energetic disharmony resulting from ill choices made in this and previous lifetimes. Benhayon teaches that there are two types of energy: prana (, ; Sanskrit for life force) and fire. Most forms of established wisdom, knowledge and belief, as well as most music and certain foods are believed to contain prana, which he regards as evil. Prana is to be rejected or cleared to be replaced with &quot;fiery energy&quot; which emanates from the &quot;Atmic womb of God&quot;. Universal Medicine healing modalities and products, including teas, herbal elixirs, creams and laminated healing symbol postcards, aim to clear prana.</p>
<p>Benhayon claims disabilities such as Autism and Down Syndrome are karma for past life sins. He also teaches that illness is caused by the possession of the body by evil spirits, and is reported to have told a terminally ill patient that an evil spirit had entered her liver and kidneys.</p>
<p>On race Benhayon writes that skin color evolution was a conscious choice and that Asians chose yellow skin, &quot;yellow signifies the intellect&quot; and the &quot;pursuit of a lighter complexion arose when Black (sic) became erroneously identified with the Darkness (sic).&quot;</p>
<p>Universal Medicine and The Way of the Livingness has followers in Australia, the UK, North America and Europe. Critics have characterised it as a cult, which has left a &quot;trail of broken families&quot;. Benhayon, who is reportedly referred to as a &quot;fifth degree initiate&quot; and &quot;The One&quot;, rejects these claims. According to the Chilling Effects website and other sources he has used legal threats to attempt to have cult allegations, including those within media reports, removed from Google search indexes. An ex-partner of a Universal Medicine supporter complained that Benhayon &quot;controlled every aspect of our lives&quot;.</p>
<p>The Way of the Livingness was denied charitable status in the UK in 2011 as it did not meet the criteria of a genuine religion.</p>

<p>Universal Medicine markets practitioner training and accreditation through the Esoteric Practitioner Association Pty Ltd, however the training is not recognized by the Australian government and &quot;esoteric practitioners&quot; are not accredited. Clients have been reported to spend tens of thousands of Australian dollars on Universal Medicine products and services.</p>
<p>Esoteric breast massage, stated by the group to be administered only by women, has been reportedly promoted to &quot;cure or prevent breast cancer&quot;. This was described as &quot;irresponsible, dangerous and misleading&quot; by Matthew Lam, research director of Breakthrough Breast Cancer. NSW Cancer Council CEO Dr Andrew Penman said there was no medical evidence massage could prevent breast cancer. Esoteric breast massage claims have also been dismissed by Breast Cancer Network Australia (BCNA). A former esoteric breast massage patient reported Universal Medicine staff told her it would prevent breast cancer by &quot;clearing&#x2026; all of men&#x2019;s negative energy&quot; accumulated over her lifetime. She recalled it as &quot;the most horrible thing I&#x2019;ve ever had in my entire life.&quot; Esoteric breast massage also claims &quot;to heal many issues such as painful periods, polycystic ovaries, endometriosis, bloating/water retention, and pre-menstrual and menopausal symptoms&quot;. Such claims have been described as &quot;ludicrous&quot; by University of NSW Emeritus Professor of Medicine, John Dwyer. According to changes recorded in the web archive, those claims were erased from the esoteric breast massage website coinciding with the onset of media scrutiny in July 2012, along with assertions such as:</p>
<dl>
<dd>&quot;The breasts are emanators of a quality of DIVINE TRUTH that begins at the heart. The heart in connection to the pubic bone chakra, which is aligned to the ovaries, brings the emanation of nurturing out for all to have.&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<p>When questioned on what aspect of health is addressed by esoteric breast massage in September 2012, Serge Benhayon stated: &quot;Disconnection to their bodies&quot;.</p>
<p>Benhayon&apos;s &quot;esoteric connective tissue therapy&quot; is said to improve the patient&apos;s energy flow by &quot;allowing the pulse of the lymphatic system to symbiotically correspond with the body&apos;s own ensheathing web&quot;. Prof. John Dwyer describes the existence of a lymphatic pulse as &quot;utter nonsense&quot;.</p>
<p>In November 2014 Universal Medicine&apos;s treatments were highlighted in a NSW Parliamentary Inquiry report by the Health Care Complaints Committee which states:</p>
<dl>
<dd>&quot;While there is little anecdotal evidence to suggest actual harm caused by these treatments, concerns were raised that patients may forego seeking proper medical advice and care. Two patients who were undergoing therapies at Universal Medicine were independently diagnosed with cancer and bronchiectasis respectively, and required proper medical intervention in order to be properly treated.&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<p>Universal Medicine has lobbied a NSW Member of Parliament to have the unfavourable comments removed from the Parliamentary Report.</p>
<p>Controversy surrounds referrals for esoteric treatments by some doctors, a situation that medical regulators say is difficult to address. Universal Medicine&apos;s registered allied health practitioners allegedly encourage followers to seek GP referral for Medicare treatment plans to pay for sessions. A former patient who received treatment from a UM physiotherapist under a Medicare plan reported the &quot;Universal physio claimed her health was improving from &apos;craniosacral pulse&apos; therapy&quot;, however, &quot;her GP ordered tests that found she had cancer.&quot; The patient was reportedly told by Universal Medicine that &quot;doctors will make you sicker than you already are&quot;.</p>
<p>Serge Benhayon has responded to such accusations with assertions Universal Medicine does not &quot;interfere with medicine... We do not hold ourselves above medicine. We are super pro medicine.&quot; Sydney paediatrician and &quot;Baby Doc&quot; author, Howard Chilton, endorses Benhayon as a &quot;teacher of enormous integrity&quot;. Chilton has given talks at the company&apos;s women&apos;s health presentations but claims his support for Universal Medicine is a personal matter unrelated to evidence based practice. Chilton&apos;s daughter is married to Benhayon&apos;s son.</p>
<p>An HCCC complainant, who was vilified on Universal Medicine websites said the organization accuses &quot;everyone else of cyberbullying while embarking on a systematic, online pack hunt&quot;. Numerous students of the organisation unknown to the complainant have openly disputed her medical conditions online. Benhayon has defended the group&#x2019;s right to do so.</p>
<p>The treatments have been characterised as &quot;sleazy&quot; with one ex-patient comparing her experience to being subjected to a &quot;grooming exercise&quot;.</p>

<p>Accusations of misconduct against Universal Medicine have drawn attention from regulatory bodies  and TGA. The NSW Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing investigated claims of breach of Australian charitable fundraising laws by the charity the &quot;College of Universal Medicine&quot; and referred these to the police.</p>
<p>Benhayon&apos;s daughter Simone (said to be a reincarnation of Winston Churchill), is one of the Trustees of The Sound Foundation, a second related charitable organisation that Universal Medicine called one of its &quot;two main world headquarters&quot;. The Sound Foundation was the subject of a 2013 complaint to the Charity Commission for England and Wales which found extensive irregularities and resulted in the charity being given a mandatory compliance plan. Benhayon is the father of four children, all who hold positions within the organisation.</p>
<p>Universal Medicine is reported to have received a portion of AUD$709,493 federal funds to provide six public lectures and &quot;counselling services to parents&quot; under a Commonwealth grant scheme applied for by the YWCA. The Australian Government refused to fully release documents explaining how the funds were used, saying &quot;YWCA raised objections&#x2026; including that the information does not accurately reflect YWCA&#x2019;s activities&quot; and could &quot;have an adverse effect on the YWCA by affecting its relationships with other entities and its reputation&quot;.</p>
<p>Critics say Universal Medicine places unreasonable pressure on followers to adhere to a severely restricted diet and to avoid most exercise for fear those things might &quot;infect their spiritual alignment&quot; and lead to poor health. Followers are reportedly told health problems result from wrongdoings in their past lives. Cult Counselling Australia director Raphael Aron said his organisation had a researcher working full-time on Universal Medicine after counselling former clients who were concerned about its influence on their children. Aron said CCA had also counselled breakaway followers, who were still &quot;battling&quot; to withdraw emotionally from the group and the organisation seemed to be &quot;exercising a level of mind control to the point where people submit to whatever this fellow seems to be offering, to their detriment... What he&#x2019;s doing is potentially very dangerous.&quot; Benhayon denies he or the group interfere in &quot;the students&quot; personal lives but detractors say relationships become impossible when everything from music to sex must be &quot;Serge-approved&quot;.</p>
<p>Benhayon confirmed the group held a &quot;book burning&quot; near Mullumbimby in 2009. Others reported it as &quot;just like the ritual burning of books in Nazi Germany&quot;, where Benhayon&apos;s students were invited to throw their books onto the pyre. Most books burnt were on Chinese medicine, kinesiology, acupuncture, homeopathy and other alternative healing modalities, all of which Benhayon had decreed &quot;prana&quot; which he considers &quot;evil&quot;.</p>
<p>In December 2015 Benhayon appeared at the New South Wales Supreme Court when his sizeable inheritance from the estate of devotee Judith McIntyre was challenged by her children. The estate was estimated to be worth $1.1 million, $600,000 of which was intended for Benhayon. A further gift of $800,000 was given to Benhayon by McIntyre three days after executing her will. Both of McIntyre&apos;s children claimed their mother had a long history of following and giving money to gurus. Justice James Stevenson declined to alter the distribution of the estate and issued a ruling stating &quot;that Ms McIntyre &#x201C;appears to have carefully considered how she should dispose of her estate&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Universal Medicine uses the services of private investigations firm Phoenix Global for online reputation management. Benhayon claims the print media has printed &quot;scurrilous lies&quot;. He and his associates have submitted numerous requests to Google Australia to remove internet links to news articles, websites or blogs that might question or criticize UM. Google Australia reportedly acted on complaints about more than 15 independent websites, as well as reports from seven news organizations.</p>
