<h1>Sivananda yoga</h1>

<p><b>Sivananda yoga</b>, after teachings of Swami Sivananda, is a non-proprietary form of hatha yoga in which the training focuses on preserving the health and wellness of the practitioner. Sivananda Yoga teachers are all graduates of the Sivananda Yoga Teacher Training Course, and students widely range in age and degrees of ability. Unlike Ashtanga vinyasa yoga&apos;s more athletic program involving <i>Bandhas</i>, Sivananda training revolves around frequent relaxation, and emphasizes full, yogic breathing.</p>




<p>The Sivananda training system aims to retain the vitality of the body and decrease chance of disease, by simply and naturally cultivating the body. The system philosophies are summarized in 5 principles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper exercise: Asanas</li>
<li>Proper breathing: Pranayama</li>
<li>Proper relaxation: Savasana</li>
<li>Proper diet: Vegetarian. A yogic diet is encouraged, limited to sattvic foods, void of rajasic foods as well as tamasic foods</li>
<li>Positive thinking and meditation: Vedanta and Dhyana</li>
</ul>

<p>A session of training typically starts with every practitioner resting in <i>Savasana</i>, and begin with Kapalabhati and Anuloma Viloma, preceding rounds of S&#x16B;rya namask&#x101;ra, before the standard program of the 12 basic asanas. A session averages 90 minutes, and the traditional program may be followed flexibly by the instructor, allowing for some variation.</p>
