<h1>Pranic healing</h1>
<p><b>Pranic Healing</b> is a claimed energy healing system developed and promoted by Choa Kok Sui (1952-2007), a Filipino entrepreneur and philanthropist of Chinese descent. The healing modality claims that prana (energy) can heal ailments in the body by contributing to the person&apos;s energy field. Sui has also stated that pranic healing is like acupuncture and yoga in that it treats the &quot;energy body&quot; which in turn affects the &quot;physical body&quot;.</p>
<p>Writing in the Times of India, Rajesh Parajapati, a student of Pranic Healing claims: &quot;The primary principle of pranic healing is utilising the inherent energy prana or energy of life in all beings for self-healing.&quot;</p>
<p>No peer-reviewed evidence or publications (in recognized medical journals) exist to support the claimed results of the practitioners. In 1995, Jack Ruso described the method in the magazine Skeptical Inquirer as &quot;mystical or supernaturalistic&quot;.</p>
