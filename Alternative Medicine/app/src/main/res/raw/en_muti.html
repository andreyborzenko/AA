<h1>Muti</h1>


<p><b>Muti</b> is a term for traditional medicine in Southern Africa as far north as Lake Tanganyika. In South African English, the word muti is derived from the Zulu word <i>umuthi</i>, meaning &quot;tree,&quot; whose root is <i>-thi</i>. In Southern Africa, cognates of the word <i>umuthi</i> (or the word &quot;muti&quot;) is in widespread use in most indigenous African languages as well as in South African English and Afrikaans, which sometimes use it as a slang word for medicine in general.</p>




<p>African traditional medicine makes use of various natural products, many derived from trees and other plants. Botanical medicine prescribed by an inyanga or herbal healer is generally known as &quot;muti&quot;, but the term can apply to other traditional medical formulations, including those that are zoological or mineral in composition.</p>
<p>Vulture brains are used for prophecy in muti.</p>

<p>This noun is of the <i>umu</i>/<i>imi</i> class so the singular (tree) is <i>umuthi</i> and the plural (trees) is <i>imithi</i>. Since the pronunciation of the initial vowel of this class is unstressed, the singular is sometimes pronounced <i>muthi</i>. The word is rendered as <i>muti</i> by the historical effects of the British colonial spelling.</p>

<p>In colloquial English and Afrikaans the word muti is often used to refer to medicines in general or medicines that have a &apos;miraculous&apos; effect, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Die dokter het &apos;muti&apos; op die seerplek gesmeer en die volgende dag was dit heeltemal gesond.&quot; (The doctor rubbed &apos;muti&apos; on the wound and the next day it was completely healed.)</li>
<li>&quot;My dokter het vir my &apos;muti&apos; verskaf vir my seer keel.&quot; (&quot;My doctor gave me some &apos;muti&apos; for my sore throat.&quot;)</li>
</ul>


<p>Occasions of murder and mutilation associated with some traditional cultural practices in South Africa are also termed <i>muti killings</i>. More correctly known as <i>medicine murder</i>, these are not human sacrifice in a religious sense, but rather involve the murder of someone in order to excise body parts for incorporation as ingredients into medicine and concoctions used in witchcraft.</p>
<p>In February 2010, Deputy Provincial Commissioner William Mpembe of the South African Police Service (SAPS) in North West Province said that &#x201C;muti murders, particularly those involving young children, seem to be on the rise in the Tshwane areas including Soshanguve, Garankuwa and Rietgat&quot; That same month, African traditional healers and the Gauteng government convened at a seminar in Pretoria, South Africa to root out the &quot;evil practice of mutilating human bodies for purposes of muti making.&quot;</p>
