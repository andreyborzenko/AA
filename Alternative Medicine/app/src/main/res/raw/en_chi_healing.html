<h1>Qi</h1>



<p>In traditional Chinese culture, <i><b>q&#xEC;</b></i> or <i><b>ch&apos;i</b></i> (, also known as <i><b>kh&#xED;</b></i> in Vietnamese culture, <i><b>gi</b></i> in Korean culture, <i><b>ki</b></i> in Japanese culture) is an active principle forming part of any living thing. <i>Qi</i> literally translates as &quot;breath&quot;, &quot;air&quot;, or &quot;gas&quot;, and figuratively as &quot;material energy&quot;, &quot;life force&quot;, or &quot;energy flow&quot;. <i>Qi</i> is the central underlying principle in traditional Chinese medicine and martial arts.</p>
<p>Concepts similar to <i>qi</i> can be found in many cultures: <i>prana</i> in Hinduism (and elsewhere in Indian culture), <i>chi</i> in the Igbo religion, <i>pneuma</i> in ancient Greece, <i>mana</i> in Hawaiian culture, <i>l&#xFC;ng</i> in Tibetan Buddhism, <i>manitou</i> in the culture of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, <i>ruah</i> in Jewish culture, and vital energy in Western philosophy.</p>
<p>Some elements of the concept of <i>qi</i> can be found in the term energy when used in the context of various esoteric forms of spirituality and alternative medicine. Elements of the concept can also be found in Western popular culture, for example &quot;The Force&quot; in <i>Star Wars</i> and the related Jediism, a religion based on the Jedi and even in Eastern popular culture like <i>Dragon Ball</i> and <i>One-Punch Man</i>. Notions in the West of <i>energeia</i>, <i>&#xE9;lan vital</i>, or vitalism are purported to be similar.</p>
<p>Despite widespread belief in the reality of <i>qi</i>, it is a non-scientific, unverifiable concept.</p>









<p>This cultural keyword <i>q&#xEC;</i> is analyzable in terms of Chinese and Sino-Xenic pronunciations, possible etymologies, the logographs &#x6C23;, &#x6C14;, and &#x6C17;, various meanings ranging from &quot;vapor&quot; to &quot;anger&quot;, and the English loanword <i>qi</i> or <i>ch&apos;i</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Characters">Characters</span></h3>
<p>In East Asian languages, Chinese <i>q&#xEC;</i> &quot;air; breath&quot; has three logographs:  is the traditional Chinese character, Korean <i>hanja</i>, and Japanese <i>ky&#x16B;jitai</i> &quot;old character form&quot; <i>kanji</i>;  is the Japanese <i>shinjitai</i> &quot;new character form&quot; <i>kanji</i>, and  is the simplified Chinese character. In addition, <i>q&#xEC;</i>  is an uncommon character especially used in writing Daoist talismans. Historically, the word <i>q&#xEC;</i> was generally written as &#x6C14; until the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE), when it was replaced by the &#x6C23; graph clarified with <i>m&#x1D0;</i>  &quot;rice&quot; indicating &quot;steam (rising from rice as it cooks)&quot;.</p>
<p>This primary graph &#x6C14; corresponds to the earliest written characters for <i>q&#xEC;</i>, which consisted of three wavy horizontal lines seen in Shang dynasty (c. 1600&#x2013;1046 BCE) oracle bone script, Zhou dynasty (1046 BCE- 256 BCE) bronzeware script and large seal script, and Qin dynasty (221-206 BCE) small seal script. These oracle, bronze, and seal scripts graphs for <i>q&#xEC;</i> &#x6C14; &quot;air; breath; etc.&quot; were anciently used as a phonetic loan character to write <i>q&#x1D0;</i> &#x4E5E; &quot;plead for; beg; ask&quot;, which did not have an early character.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Chinese characters are classified as radical-phonetic characters, which combine a semantically suggestive &quot;radical&quot; or &quot;signific&quot; with a &quot;phonetic&quot; element approximating ancient pronunciation. For example, the widely known word <i>d&#xE0;o</i>  &quot;the Dao; the way&quot; graphically combines the &quot;walk&quot; radical &#x8FB6; with a <i>sh&#x1D2;u</i> &#x9996; &quot;head&quot; phonetic&#x2014;although the modern <i>d&#xE0;o</i> and <i>sh&#x1D2;u</i> pronunciations are dissimilar, the Old Chinese <i>*l&#x2E4;u&#x294;-s</i> &#x9053; and <i>*l&#x325;u&#x294;-s</i> &#x9996; were alike. The regular script character <i>q&#xEC;</i>  is unusual because <i>q&#xEC;</i>  is both the &quot;air radical&quot; and the phonetic, with <i>m&#x1D0;</i> &#x7C73; &quot;rice&quot; semantically indicating &quot;steam; vapor&quot;.</p>
<p>This <i>q&#xEC;</i> &#x6C14; &quot;air/gas radical&quot;, which was only used in a few native Chinese characters like <i>y&#x12B;ny&#x16B;n</i> &#x6C24;&#x6C32; &quot;thick mist/smoke&quot;, was used to create new scientific characters for gaseous chemical elements. Some examples are based on pronunciations in European languages: <i>f&#xFA;</i> &#x6C1F; (with a <i>f&#xFA;</i> &#x5F17; phonetic) &quot;fluorine&quot; and <i>n&#x1CE;i</i> &#x6C16; (with a <i>n&#x1CE;i</i> &#x4E43; phonetic) &quot;neon&quot;; others are based on semantics: <i>q&#x12B;ng</i> &#x6C2B; (with a <i>j&#x12B;ng</i> &#x5DE0; phonetic, abbreviating <i>q&#x12B;ng</i> &#x8F15; &quot;light-weight&quot;) &quot;hydrogen (the lightest element)&quot; and <i>l&#x1DC;</i> &#x6C2F; (with a <i>l&#xF9;</i> &#x5F54; phonetic, abbreviating <i>l&#x1DC;</i> &#x7DA0; &quot;green&quot;) &quot;(greenish-yellow) chlorine&quot;.</p>
<p><i>Q&#xEC;</i> &#x6C23; is the phonetic element in a few characters such as <i>k&#xE0;i</i> &#x613E; &quot;hate&quot; with the &quot;heart-mind radical&quot; &#x5FC4;or &#x5FC3;, <i>x&#xEC;</i> &#x7182; &quot;set fire to weeds&quot; with the &quot;fire radical&quot; &#x706B;, and <i>x&#xEC;</i> &#x993C; &quot;to present food&quot; with the &quot;food radical&quot; &#x98DF;.</p>
<p>The first Chinese dictionary of characters, the (121 CE) <i>Shuowen Jiezi</i> notes that the primary <i>q&#xEC;</i> &#x6C14; is a pictographic character depicting &#x96F2;&#x6C14; &quot;cloudy vapors&quot;, and that the full &#x6C23; combines &#x7C73; &quot;rice&quot; with the phonetic <i>qi</i> &#x6C14;, meaning &#x994B;&#x5BA2;&#x82BB;&#x7C73; &quot;present provisions to guests&quot; (later disambiguated as <i>x&#xEC;</i> &#x993C;).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Meanings">Meanings</span></h3>
<p><i>Qi</i> is a polysemous word; the unabridged Chinese-Chinese character dictionary <i>Hanyu Da Zidian</i> lists one meaning &quot;present food or provisions&quot; for the <i>x&#xEC;</i> pronunciation and 23 meanings for the <i>q&#xEC;</i> pronunciation. The modern <i>ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary</i>, which enters <i>x&#xEC;</i> &#x993C; &quot;grain; animal feed; make a present of food&quot; but not classical <i>x&#xEC;</i> &#x6C23;, has a <i>q&#xEC;</i> &#x6C23; entry giving seven translation equivalents for the noun, two for bound morphemes, and three for the verb.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="English_borrowing">English borrowing</span></h3>
<p><i>Qi</i> was an early Chinese loanword in English, romanized as: <i>k&apos;i</i> in Church Romanization in the early-19th century, <i>ch&apos;i</i> in Wade&#x2013;Giles in the mid-19th century (sometimes misspelled <i>chi</i> omitting the apostrophe indicating aspirated consonant stops, e.g., spelling the martial art <i>ch&apos;i kung</i> as &quot;<i>chi kung</i>&quot;), and <i>qi</i> in Pinyin in the mid-20th century. The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> entry for <i>qi</i> gives the pronunciation as IPA (t&#x283;i), the etymology from Chinese <i>q&#xEC;</i> &quot;air; breath&quot;, and a definition of &quot;The physical life-force postulated by certain Chinese philosophers; the material principle.&quot; The <i>OED</i> gives eight usage examples, with the first recorded example of <i>k&apos;&#xED;</i> in 1850 (<i>The Chinese Repository</i>), of <i>ch&apos;i</i> in 1917 (<i>The Encyclopaedia Sinica</i>), and <i>qi</i> in 1971 (Felix Mann&apos;s <i>Acupuncture</i>)</p>


<p>References to concepts analogous to the <i>qi</i> taken to be the life-process or flow of energy that sustains living beings are found in many belief systems, especially in Asia. Philosophical conceptions of <i>qi</i> from the earliest records of Chinese philosophy (5th century BCE) correspond to Western notions of humours, the ancient Hindu yogic concept of <i>prana</i> (&quot;life force&quot; in Sanskrit) and traditional Jewish sources refer to as the Nefesh level of soul within the body. An early form of the idea comes from the writings of the Chinese philosopher Mencius (4th century BCE). Historically, the <i>Huangdi Neijing</i>/&quot;<i>The Yellow Emperor&apos;s Classic of Medicine</i>&quot; (circa 2nd century BCE) is credited with first establishing the pathways through which <i>qi</i> circulates in the human body.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>Within the framework of Chinese thought, no notion may attain such a degree of abstraction from empirical data as to correspond perfectly to one of our modern universal concepts. Nevertheless, the term <i>qi</i> comes as close as possible to constituting a generic designation equivalent to our word &quot;energy&quot;. When Chinese thinkers are unwilling or unable to fix the quality of an energetic phenomenon, the character <i>qi</i> (&#x6C23;) inevitably flows from their brushes.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The ancient Chinese described it as &quot;life force&quot;. They believed <i>qi</i> permeated everything and linked their surroundings together. They likened it to the flow of energy around and through the body, forming a cohesive and functioning unit. By understanding its rhythm and flow they believed they could guide exercises and treatments to provide stability and longevity.</p>
<p>Although the concept of <i>qi</i> has been important within many Chinese philosophies, over the centuries the descriptions of <i>qi</i> have varied and have sometimes been in conflict. Until China came into contact with Western scientific and philosophical ideas, they had not categorized all things in terms of matter and energy. <i>Qi</i> and <i>li</i> (&#x7406;: &quot;pattern&quot;) were &apos;fundamental&apos; categories similar to matter and energy.</p>
<p>Fairly early on, some Chinese thinkers began to believe that there were different fractions of <i>qi</i> and that the coarsest and heaviest fractions of <i>qi</i> formed solids, lighter fractions formed liquids, and the most ethereal fractions were the &quot;lifebreath&quot; that animates living beings.</p>
<p><i>Yu&#xE1;n q&#xEC;</i> is a notion of innate or pre-natal <i>qi</i> to distinguish it from acquired <i>qi</i> that a person may develop over the course of their lifetime.</p>


<p>The earliest texts that speak of <i>qi</i> give some indications of how the concept developed. The philosopher Mo Di used the word <i>qi</i> to refer to noxious vapors that would in due time arise from a corpse were it not buried at a sufficient depth. He reported that early civilized humans learned how to live in houses to protect their <i>qi</i> from the moisture that had troubled them when they lived in caves. He also associated maintaining one&apos;s <i>qi</i> with providing oneself adequate nutrition. In regard to another kind of <i>qi</i>, he recorded how some people performed a kind of prognostication by observing the <i>qi</i> (clouds) in the sky.</p>
<p>In the Analects of Confucius, compiled from the notes of his students sometime after his death in 479 B.C., <i>qi</i> could mean &quot;breath&quot;, and combining it with the Chinese word for blood (making &#x8840;&#x6C23;, <i>xue</i>-<i>qi</i>, blood and breath), the concept could be used to account for motivational characteristics.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The [morally] noble man guards himself against 3 things. When he is young, his <i>xue</i>-<i>qi</i> has not yet stabilized, so he guards himself against sexual passion. When he reaches his prime, his <i>xue</i>-<i>qi</i> is not easily subdued, so he guards himself against combativeness. When he reaches old age, his <i>xue</i>-<i>qi</i> is already depleted, so he guards himself against acquisitiveness.</p>

<p>Mencius described a kind of <i>qi</i> that might be characterized as an individual&apos;s vital energies. This <i>qi</i> was necessary to activity and it could be controlled by a well-integrated willpower. When properly nurtured, this <i>qi</i> was said to be capable of extending beyond the human body to reach throughout the universe. It could also be augmented by means of careful exercise of one&apos;s moral capacities. On the other hand, the <i>qi</i> of an individual could be degraded by adverse external forces that succeed in operating on that individual.</p>
<p>Not only human beings and animals were believed to have <i>qi</i>. Zhuangzi indicated that wind is the <i>qi</i> of the Earth. Moreover, cosmic yin and yang &quot;are the greatest of <i>qi</i>.&quot; He described <i>qi</i> as &quot;issuing forth&quot; and creating profound effects. He said &quot;Human beings are born [because of] the accumulation of <i>qi</i>. When it accumulates there is life. When it dissipates there is death... There is one <i>qi</i> that connects and pervades everything in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Another passage traces life to intercourse between Heaven and Earth: &quot;The highest Yin is the most restrained. The highest Yang is the most exuberant. The restrained comes forth from Heaven. The exuberant issues forth from Earth. The two intertwine and penetrate forming a harmony, and [as a result] things are born.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Guanzi essay <b>Neiye</b> &#x5167;&#x696D; (Inward training) is the oldest received writing on the subject of the cultivation of vapor <i>[qi]</i> and meditation techniques. The essay was probably composed at the Jixia Academy in Qi in the late fourth century B.C.&quot;</p>
<p>Xun Zi, another Confucian scholar of the Jixia Academy, followed in later years. At 9:69/127, Xun Zi says, &quot;Fire and water have <i>qi</i> but do not have life. Grasses and trees have life but do not have perceptivity. Fowl and beasts have perceptivity but do not have <i>yi</i> (sense of right and wrong, duty, justice). Men have <i>qi</i>, life, perceptivity, and <i>yi</i>.&quot; Chinese people at such an early time had no concept of radiant energy, but they were aware that one can be heated by a campfire from a distance away from the fire. They accounted for this phenomenon by claiming &quot;<i>qi</i>&quot; radiated from fire. At 18:62/122, he also uses &quot;<i>qi</i>&quot; to refer to the vital forces of the body that decline with advanced age.</p>
<p>Among the animals, the gibbon and the crane were considered experts at inhaling the <i>qi</i>. The Confucian scholar Dong Zhongshu (ca. 150 BC) wrote in Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals: &quot;The gibbon resembles a macaque, but he is larger, and his color is black. His forearms being long, he lives eight hundred years, because he is expert in controlling his breathing.&quot; (&quot;&#x733F;&#x4F3C;&#x7334;&#x3002;&#x5927;&#x800C;&#x9ED1;&#x3002;&#x9577;&#x524D;&#x81C2;&#x3002;&#x6240;&#x4EE5;&#x58FD;&#x516B;&#x767E;&#x3002;&#x597D;&#x5F15;&#x6C23;&#x4E5F;&#x3002;&quot;)</p>
<p>Later, the syncretic text assembled under the direction of Liu An, the Huai Nan Zi, or &quot;Masters of Huainan&quot;, has a passage that presages most of what is given greater detail by the Neo-Confucians:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>Heaven (seen here as the ultimate source of all being) falls (<i>duo</i> &#x58AE;, i.e., descends into proto-immanence) as the formless. Fleeting, fluttering, penetrating, amorphous it is, and so it is called the Supreme Luminary. The <i>dao</i> begins in the Void Brightening. The Void Brightening produces the universe (<i>yu</i>-<i>zhou</i>). The universe produces <i>qi</i>. <i>Qi</i> has bounds. The clear, yang <i>[qi]</i> was ethereal and so formed heaven. The heavy, turbid <i>[qi]</i> was congealed and impeded and so formed earth. The conjunction of the clear, yang <i>[qi]</i> was fluid and easy. The conjunction of the heavy, turbid <i>[qi]</i> was strained and difficult. So heaven was formed first and earth was made fast later. The pervading essence (<i>xi</i>-<i>jing</i>) of heaven and earth becomes yin and yang. The concentrated (<i>zhuan</i>) essences of yin and yang become the four seasons. The dispersed (<i>san</i>) essences of the four seasons become the myriad creatures. The hot <i>qi</i> of yang in accumulating produces fire. The essence (<i>jing</i>) of the fire-<i>qi</i> becomes the sun. The cold <i>qi</i> of yin in accumulating produces water. The essence of the water-<i>qi</i> becomes the moon. The essences produced by coitus (yin) of the sun and moon become the stars and celestial markpoints (<i>chen</i>, planets).</p>

<p>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) asserts that the body has natural patterns of <i>qi</i> that circulate in channels called meridians.</p>
<p>In TCM, symptoms of various illnesses are believed to be the product of disrupted, blocked, or unbalanced <i>qi</i> movement through the body&apos;s meridians, as well as deficiencies or imbalances of <i>qi</i> in the Zang Fu organs. Traditional Chinese medicine often seeks to relieve these imbalances by adjusting the circulation of <i>qi</i> using a variety of techniques including herbology, food therapy, physical training regimens (qigong, t&apos;ai chi ch&apos;uan, and other martial arts training), moxibustion, <i>tui na</i>, and acupuncture.</p>

<p>A <i>qi</i> field (<i>chu-chong</i>) refers to the cultivation of an energy field by a group, typically for healing or other benevolent purposes. A <i>qi</i> field is believed to be produced by visualization and affirmation, and is an important component of Wisdom Healing Qigong (<i>Zhineng Qigong</i>), founded by Grandmaster Ming Pang.</p>

<p>Qi is a non-scientific, unverifiable concept.</p>
<p>A United States National Institutes of Health consensus statement on acupuncture in 1997 noted that concepts such as <i>qi</i> &quot;are difficult to reconcile with contemporary biomedical information.&quot;</p>
<p>The April 22, 2014, Skeptoid podcast episode titled &quot;Your Body&apos;s Alleged Energy Fields&quot; relates a Reiki practitioner&apos;s report of what was happening as she passed her hands over a subject&apos;s body:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p><i>What we&apos;ll be looking for here, within John&apos;s auric field, is any areas of intense heat, unusual coldness, a repelling energy, a dense energy, a magnetizing energy, tingling sensations, or actually the body attracting the hands into that area where it needs the reiki energy, and balancing of John&apos;s qi.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evaluating these claims scientific skeptic author Brian Dunning reported:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>...his aura, his qi, his reiki energy. None of these have any counterpart in the physical world. Although she attempted to describe their properties as heat or magnetism, those properties are already taken by - well, heat and magnetism. There are no properties attributable to the mysterious field she describes, thus it cannot be authoritatively said to exist.&quot;</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feng_shui">Feng shui</span></h3>

<p>The traditional Chinese art of geomancy, the placement and arrangement of space called feng shui, is based on calculating the balance of <i>qi</i>, interactions between the five elements, yin and yang, and other factors. The retention or dissipation of <i>qi</i> is believed to affect the health, wealth, energy level, luck and many other aspects of the occupants of the space. Attributes of each item in a space affect the flow of <i>qi</i> by slowing it down, redirecting it or accelerating it, which is said to influence the energy level of the occupants.</p>
<p>One use for a <i>luopan</i> is to detect the flow of <i>qi</i>. The quality of <i>qi</i> may rise and fall over time, feng shui with a compass might be considered a form of divination that assesses the quality of the local environment.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Qigong">Qigong</span></h3>

<p><i>Q&#xEC;g&#x14D;ng</i> (&#x6C14;&#x529F; or &#x6C23;&#x529F;) is a practice involving coordinated breathing, movement, and awareness, traditionally viewed as a practice to cultivate and balance <i>qi</i>. With roots in traditional Chinese medicine, philosophy, and martial arts, <i>qigong</i> is now practiced worldwide for exercise, healing, meditation, and training for martial arts. Typically a <i>qigong</i> practice involves rhythmic breathing coordinated with slow stylized movement, a calm mindful state, and visualization of guiding <i>qi</i>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Martial_arts">Martial arts</span></h3>

<p><i>Qi</i> is a didactic concept in many Chinese, Korean and Japanese martial arts. Martial <i>qigong</i> is a feature of both internal and external training systems in China and other East Asian cultures. The most notable of the <i>qi</i>-focused &quot;internal&quot; force (jin) martial arts are Baguazhang, Xing Yi Quan, T&apos;ai Chi Ch&apos;uan, Southern Praying Mantis, Snake Kung Fu, Southern Dragon Kung Fu, Aikido, Kendo, Aikijujutsu, Luohan Quan and Liu He Ba Fa.</p>
<p>Demonstrations of <i>qi</i> or <i>ki</i> are popular in some martial arts and may include the immovable body, the unraisable body, the unbendable arm, and other feats of power. Some of these feats can alternatively be explained using biomechanics and physics.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Acupuncture_and_moxibustion">Acupuncture and moxibustion</span></h3>

<p>Acupuncture is a part of traditional Chinese medicine that involves insertion of needles into superficial structures of the body (skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscles) at acupuncture points to balance the flow of <i>qi</i>. Acupuncture is often accompanied by moxibustion, a treatment that involves burning mugwort on or near the skin at an acupuncture point.</p>
