<h1>Reiki</h1>



<p><b>Reiki</b>  is a form of alternative medicine developed in 1922 by Japanese Buddhist Mikao Usui. Since originating in Japan, Reiki has been adapted into varying cultural traditions across the world. Reiki practitioners use a technique called <i>palm healing</i> or <i>hands-on healing</i> through which a &quot;universal energy&quot; is allegedly transferred through the palms of the practitioner to the patient in order to encourage emotional or physical healing.</p>
<p>Reiki is pseudoscience. It is based on <i>qi</i> (&quot;chi&quot;), which practitioners say is a universal life force, although there is no empirical evidence that such a life force exists. Clinical research has not shown Reiki to be effective as a medical treatment for any medical condition. The American Cancer Society, Cancer Research UK, and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health state that Reiki should not be a replacement for conventional treatment.</p>






<p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the English alternative medicine word <i>reiki</i> or <i>Reiki</i> is etymologically from Japanese <i>reiki</i> () &quot;mysterious atmosphere, miraculous sign&quot; (first recorded in 1001), combining <i>rei</i> &quot;soul, spirit&quot; and <i>ki</i> &quot;vital energy&quot;&#x2014;the Sino-Japanese reading of Chinese <i>l&#xED;ngq&#xEC;</i> () &quot;numinous atmosphere&quot;. The earliest recorded English usage dates to 1975.</p>
<p>The Japanese <i>reiki</i> is commonly written as &#x30EC;&#x30A4;&#x30AD; in katakana syllabary or as &#x970A;&#x6C17; in shinjitai &quot;new character form&quot; kanji. It compounds the words <i>rei</i> (: &quot;spirit, miraculous, divine&quot;) and <i>ki</i> (; qi: &quot;gas, vital energy, breath of life, consciousness&quot;). <i>Ki</i> is additionally defined as &quot;... spirits; one&apos;s feelings, mood, frame of mind; temperament, temper, disposition, one&apos;s nature, character; mind to do something, intention, will; care, attention, precaution&quot;. Some <i>reiki</i> translation equivalents from Japanese-English dictionaries are: &quot;feeling of mystery&quot;, &quot;an atmosphere (feeling) of mystery&quot;, and &quot;an ethereal atmosphere (that prevails in the sacred precincts of a shrine); (feel, sense) a spiritual (divine) presence.&quot; Besides the usual Sino-Japanese pronunciation <i>reiki</i>, these kanji &#x970A;&#x6C17; have an alternate Japanese reading, namely <i>ry&#x14D;ge</i>, meaning &quot;demon; ghost&quot; (especially in spirit possession).</p>
<p>Chinese <i>l&#xED;ngq&#xEC;</i> &#x9748;&#x6C23; was first recorded in the (ca. 320 BCE) <i>Neiye</i> &quot;Inward Training&quot; section of the <i>Guanzi</i>, describing early Daoist meditation techniques. &quot;That mysterious vital energy within the mind: One moment it arrives, the next it departs. So fine, there is nothing within it; so vast, there is nothing outside it. We lose it because of the harm caused by mental agitation.&quot; Modern Standard Chinese <i>l&#xED;ngq&#xEC;</i> is translated by Chinese-English dictionaries as: &quot;(of beautiful mountains) spiritual influence or atmosphere&quot;; &quot;1. intelligence; power of understanding; 2. supernatural power or force in fairy tales; miraculous power or force&quot;; and &quot;1. spiritual influence (of mountains/etc.); 2. ingeniousness; cleverness&quot;.</p>

<p>According to the inscription on his memorial stone, Usui taught his system of Reiki to more than 2,000 people during his lifetime. While teaching Reiki in Fukuyama (&#x798F;&#x5C71;&#x5E02;, <i>Fukuyama-shi</i>), Usui suffered a stroke and died on 9 March 1926.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Basis_and_effectiveness">Basis and effectiveness</span></h3>

<p>Reiki&apos;s teachings and adherents claim that <i>qi</i> is physiological and can be manipulated to treat a disease or condition. The existence of qi has not been established by medical research. Therefore, Reiki is a pseudoscientific theory based on metaphysical concepts.</p>
<p>The existence of the proposed mechanism for Reiki&#xA0;&#x2013; <i>qi</i> or &quot;life force&quot; energy&#xA0;&#x2013; has not been established. Most research on Reiki is poorly designed and prone to bias. There is no reliable empirical evidence that Reiki is helpful for treating any medical condition, although some physicians have said it might help promote general well-being. In 2011, William T. Jarvis of The National Council Against Health Fraud stated that there &quot;is no evidence that clinical Reiki&apos;s effects are due to anything other than suggestion&quot; or the placebo effect.</p>
<p>The April 22, 2014 Skeptoid podcast episode titled &quot;Your Body&apos;s Alleged Energy Fields&quot; relates a Reiki practitioner&apos;s report of what was happening as she passed her hands over a subject&apos;s body:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>What we&apos;ll be looking for here, within John&apos;s auric field, is any areas of intense heat, unusual coldness, a repelling energy, a dense energy, a magnetizing energy, tingling sensations, or actually the body attracting the hands into that area where it needs the reiki energy, and balancing of John&apos;s qi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evaluating these claims scientific skeptic author Brian Dunning reported:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>...his aura, his qi, his reiki energy. None of these have any counterpart in the physical world. Although she attempted to describe their properties as heat or magnetism, those properties are already taken by &#x2013; well, heat and magnetism. There are no properties attributable to the mysterious field she describes, thus it cannot be authoritatively said to exist.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Scholarly_evaluation">Scholarly evaluation</span></h3>
<p>Reiki is used as an illustrative example of pseudoscience in scholarly texts and academic journal articles. Emily Rosa became the youngest person to publish in the medical literature at 11 years old when her school science project was published by the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> demonstrating that Reiki practitioners could not detect the alleged &quot;life force&quot; under experimental conditions.</p>
<p>Rhonda McClenton states, &quot;The reality is that Reiki, under the auspices of pseudo-science, has begun the process of becoming institutionalized in settings where people are already very vulnerable.&quot; In criticizing the State University of New York for offering a continuing education course on Reiki, Lilienfeld et al. (in <i>Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology</i>) state, &quot;Reiki postulates the existence of a universal energy unknown to science and thus far undetectable surrounding the human body, which practitioners can learn to manipulate using their hands.&quot; Ferraresi et al. state, &quot;In spite of its [Reiki] diffusion, the baseline mechanism of action has not been demonstrated...&quot; Wendy Reiboldt states about Reiki, &quot;Neither the forces involved nor the alleged therapeutic benefits have been demonstrated by scientific testing.&quot; Several authors have pointed to the vitalistic energy which Reiki is claimed to treat. Larry Sarner states (in <i>The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience</i>), &quot;Ironically, the only thing that distinguishes Reiki from Therapeutic Touch is that it involves actual touch.&quot; Massimo Pigliucci and Maarten Boudry state (in <i>Philosophy of Pseudoscience</i>) that the International Center for Reiki Training &quot;mimic[s] the institutional aspects of science&quot; seeking legitimacy but holds no more promise than an alchemy society.</p>
<p>A guideline published by the American Academy of Neurology, the American Association of Neuromuscular &amp; Electrodiagnostic Medicine, and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation states, &quot;Reiki therapy should probably not be considered for the treatment of PDN [painful diabetic neuropathy].&quot; Canadian sociologist Susan J. Palmer has listed Reiki as among the pseudoscientific healing methods used by cults in France to attract members.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Issues_in_literature">Issues in literature</span></h3>
<p>One systematic review of 9 randomized clinical trials conducted by Lee, Pittler, and Ernst (2008) found several issues in the literature on Reiki. First, several of these studies are actually funded by the US National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Second, depending on the tools used to measure depression and anxiety, the results varied and didn&#x2019;t appear to have much reliability or validity. Furthermore, the scientific community has had issues in replicating the findings of studies that support Reiki. The authors of the review also found issues in reporting methodology in some of the literature, in that often there were parts left out completely or not clearly described. Frequently in these studies, sample sizes are not calculated and adequate allocation and conceal procedures were also not followed. In their review, Lee, Pittler, and Ernst (2008) found that studies without double-blind procedures tended to exaggerate treatment effects as well. Additionally, there was no control for differences in experience of the Reiki administers and they found that even the same healer could produce different outcomes in different studies. None of the studies in the review provided rationale for the treatment duration in such that there is a need for an optimal dosage of Reiki to be established for further research. Another questionable issue with the Reiki research included in this systematic review was that no study reported any adverse effects. It is clear that this area of research requires further studies to be conducted that follow proper scientific method, especially since the main theory on which the therapy is based has never been scientifically proven.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Safety">Safety</span></h3>

<p>Safety concerns for Reiki sessions are very low and are akin to those of many complementary and alternative medicine practices. Some physicians and health care providers, however, believe that patients may unadvisedly substitute proven treatments for life-threatening conditions with unproven alternative modalities including Reiki, thus endangering their health.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Catholic_Church_concerns">Catholic Church concerns</span></h3>
<p>In March 2009, the Committee on Doctrine of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops issued the document <i>Guidelines for Evaluating Reiki as an Alternative Therapy</i>, in which they declared that the practice of Reiki was superstition, being neither truly faith healing nor science-based medicine. The guideline concluded that &quot;since Reiki therapy is not compatible with either Christian teaching or scientific evidence, it would be inappropriate for Catholic institutions, such as Catholic health care facilities and retreat centers, or persons representing the Church, such as Catholic chaplains, to promote or to provide support for Reiki therapy.&quot; Since this announcement, some Catholic lay people have continued to practice reiki, but it has been removed from many Catholic hospitals and other institutions.</p>
