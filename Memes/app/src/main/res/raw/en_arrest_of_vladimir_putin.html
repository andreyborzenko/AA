<h1>Arrest of Vladimir Putin viral video</h1>
<p>&quot;<b>Arrest of Vladimir Putin: A Report from the Courtroom</b>&quot; is a viral video, originally posted on YouTube on February 13, 2012 by the Russian video publishing group &quot;Lancelot&quot;. The mock video shows Russian President (then Prime Minister) Vladimir Putin facing a courtroom trial. The footage was taken from the real-life trial of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and then digitally altered to make a faux news report. Putin&apos;s reply to the judge is taken from television footage where Putin is participating in the 2010 census.</p>
<p>The video was viewed nearly 3 million times within three days and as of December 17, 2014 has over 7 million views. Khodorkovsky&apos;s legal team placed a link to the video on his Twitter feed. The video was also reposted at the LiveJournal blog of Alexey Navalny.</p>
<p>Putin&apos;s supporters made their own prank video in response, titled &quot;Russia Without Putin &#x2013; Russia Without a Future&quot;. The video plays on the popular &quot;Russia without Putin&quot; chant that was frequently used during the opposition protests in Russia.</p>
<p>Following the posting of Putin&apos;s mock arrest, it was revealed that its video is a trailer of the unreleased Russian documentary <i>A Coup On Russia</i>, filmed in 2002.</p>
