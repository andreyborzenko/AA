<h1>Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny</h1>
<p>&quot;<b>The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny</b>&quot;, often shortened to &quot;<b>The Ultimate Showdown</b>&quot;, is a comical song and video released on December 22, 2005. The song was written and performed by Neil Cicierega under the pseudonym &quot;Lemon Demon&quot;, with art and Flash animation by Shawn Vulliez.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ultimate Showdown&quot; is a massive, city-wide battle set in Tokyo started by Godzilla and Batman ultimately involving dozens of pop-culture icons, fictional and otherwise, ending with Mr. Rogers emerging victorious and then committing seppuku. It gained a large cult following among web enthusiasts and became the &quot;User&apos;s Choice&quot; on December 28, 2005 on Newgrounds, where it has been viewed over 12 million times. It appeared on several other websites including Albino Blacksheep, YouTube, Transbuddha, and Weebl&apos;s Stuff. In 2006 it was included on Lemon Demon&apos;s fifth album <i>Dinosaurchestra</i>. As of December 2015, it had over 16 million views on YouTube.</p>
<p>The song topped the &quot;Funny Five&quot; on <i>The Dr. Demento Show</i> for several weeks and was the #1 Request for 2006. The video has since been parodied and referenced repeatedly in other flash videos. A new version of the song was later recorded specifically for the Rock Band Network and was released for the service on July 6, 2010 under the title <i>The Ultimate Showdown (RBN Mix)</i>. In 2009, the song was rerecorded with a full band, and this track was included in Lemon Demon&apos;s 2011 EP &quot;Live (Only Not)&quot;.</p>
