<h1>Banana Sprite challenge</h1>
<p>The <b>Banana Sprite challenge</b> is a challenge to quickly eat two bananas and drink one can of Sprite without vomiting. There are other versions of the challenge, but the suggested premise is that the body cannot digest both substances at the same time.</p>
<p>While the vomit response is commonly assumed to be a chemical reaction between the two foods, the reaction may also occur due simply to the large amount of food and drink ingested within a short period. Dietician Heather Boline observes that the human stomach can only hold around two cups, saying &quot;Too much food or liquid in your stomach if your stomach doesn&#x2019;t have that capability can make you vomit.&quot;</p>
