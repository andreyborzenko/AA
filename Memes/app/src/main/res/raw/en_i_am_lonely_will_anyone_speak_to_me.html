<h1>I am lonely will anyone speak to me</h1><p>&quot;<b>i am lonely will anyone speak to me</b>&quot; is the title of a thread that was posted on the Internet forum of the video codec downloads site Moviecodec.com, and had become &quot;the web&apos;s top hangout for lonely folk.&quot; The thread began July 14, 2004; it was the first hit when the phrase &quot;I am lonely&quot; was entered into the Google search engine though it has since dropped.</p>
<p>It was featured in the magazines <i>Wired</i>, <i>Guardian Unlimited</i>, and <i>The New Yorker</i>. Bjarne Lundgren, the webmaster of Moviecodec.com, has stated &quot;Like-minded people tend to flock together and, in this case, Google helped in flocking them together on my site&quot;.</p>
<p>Mark Griffiths, a researcher in internet psychology at Nottingham Trent University in the UK, also addressed this question, stating: &quot;There are a lot of lonely people out there. Some people rely heavily on technology and end up treating it as an electronic friend, a sounding board &#x2014; just writing it down can make you feel better... That doesn&apos;t change their psychological world at that moment, but creating a kinship with like-minded people can help. You&apos;re all in this virtual space together.&quot;</p>
<p>Due to its large community, Bjarne created a new forum entitled &quot;A Lonely Life&quot;, for the thread&apos;s numerous lonely inhabitants to move to. The original thread is now located on Moviecodec.com&apos;s branch site, The Lounge Forums.</p>
<p>As of December 24, 2016, the website the thread is hosted on was shut down and can no longer be accessed. A spiritual successor to the original site called Take Five Forums was formed in May 2015, and is home to many of the members from The Lounge as well as a thread with the same title.</p>
