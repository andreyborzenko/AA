<h1>Twitch Plays Pok&#xE9;mon</h1>
<p><b>Twitch Plays <i>Pok&#xE9;mon</i></b> (<b>TPP</b>) is a &quot;social experiment&quot; and channel on the video streaming website Twitch, consisting of a crowdsourced attempt to play Game Freak&apos;s and Nintendo&apos;s Pok&#xE9;mon video games by parsing commands sent by users through the channel&apos;s chat room.</p>
<p>The concept was developed by an anonymous Australian programmer and launched on 12 February 2014, starting with the game <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Red</i>. The stream became unexpectedly popular, reaching an average concurrent viewership of over 80,000 viewers (with at least 10% participating). On 1 March 2014, the game was completed after more than 16 continuous days of gameplay; Twitch estimated that over 1.16 million people participated, with peak simultaneous participation at 121,000, and with a total of 55 million views during the experiment. On 5 December 2014, Twitch Plays <i>Pok&#xE9;mon</i> received a Game Award in the &quot;Best Fan Creation&quot; category.</p>
<p>The experiment was met with attention by media outlets and staff members of Twitch for its interactivity, its erratic and chaotic nature, the unique challenges faced by players due to the mechanics of its system, and the community and memes developed by participants. Following the completion of <i>Red</i>, the broadcaster continued the channel with <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Crystal</i>, <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Emerald</i>, <i>Pok&#xE9;mon FireRed</i>, <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Platinum</i>, <i>Pok&#xE9;mon HeartGold</i>, <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Black</i>, <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Black Version 2</i>, <i>Pok&#xE9;mon X</i>, <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Omega Ruby</i>, <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Sun</i>, <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Colosseum</i>, <i>Pok&#xE9;mon XD</i>, and various ROM hacks. The broadcaster has plans to continue with other <i>Pok&#xE9;mon</i> games as long as there remains interest in the channel. The success of the experiment led to a number of similar Twitch-based streams for other games, and led Twitch to promote more streams with similar interactivity with watchers.</p>




<p>Inspired by another Twitch-based interactive game, <i>Salty Bet</i> (a website where users could wager on the outcome of randomized <i>M.U.G.E.N.</i> matches) and described as a social experiment, the system used by the stream was coded by an anonymous Australian programmer, consisting of an IRC bot written in Python and the Game Boy emulator VisualBoyAdvance. The script captures specific messages (directional commands, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;select&quot;, and &quot;start&quot;) sent into the stream&apos;s chat room by users, and sends them to the emulator as button input, thus controlling the game. An additional web app coded using JavaScript is used to display a live tally of moves that are shown within the stream. The broadcaster chose <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Red</i> and <i>Blue</i> for the project, citing nostalgia for the early games, the fact that &quot;Even when played very poorly it is difficult not to make progress in <i>Pok&#xE9;mon</i>&quot;, and because its current control structure &quot;[wouldn&apos;t] work with any genre that isn&apos;t a JRPG&quot;, particularly targeting its &quot;forgiving&quot; turn-based structure and lack of reaction-based gameplay, compensating for the large amount of input lag between the game and the stream. The author used an edited version of the game, which claims to make all the original 151 Pok&#xE9;mon accessible, in hopes of making completion of the Pok&#xE9;dex a possibility. However, the edited version used was unfinished and has no gameplay differences when compared to the original game.</p>
<p>The erratic nature of the control scheme has made the game longer and harder to play than under normal circumstances; an <i>Ars Technica</i> writer commented that &quot;(Red) gets stuck in corners. He walks in circles, compulsively checking his Pok&#xE9;dex and saving over and over again. Commands stream in from the chat channel faster than the game can possibly process them, making progress difficult-to-impossible even without the lag factor or the &apos;help&apos; of gleeful trolls.&quot; Recurring difficulties have occurred with areas of the game involving mazes and ledges (areas with the latter taking as long as several hours to navigate due to users intentionally sending &quot;down&quot; commands to jump off the ledges), the accidental release of several Pok&#xE9;mon (including an incident referred to as &quot;Bloody Sunday,&quot; where a total of twelve Pok&#xE9;mon were accidentally released whilst trying to manipulate the character&apos;s party), and users repeatedly sending &quot;start&quot; commands to open the pause menu, often followed by opening the character&apos;s inventory to select random items. A system to throttle inputs on the Start button was added to mitigate this particular effect.</p>
<p>Despite the seemingly erratic process of playing the game, players have attempted to collaborate and strategize through various means, including infographics and a user script which hides command messages from the chat window to allow conversation. This was necessary for the players to progress as several areas of the game require coordinated actions to gain Pok&#xE9;mon with a specific skill needed to clear obstacles in Red&apos;s way, and earlier attempts without such coordination resulted in missing out on specific opportunities early on in the playthrough. In essence, the majority of players have attempted to counteract trolls trying to impede progress. A computer program was even created to automatically identify these trolls.</p>

<p>On 18 February 2014, after encountering major difficulties with a puzzle in the Team Rocket hideout, a new mechanic was introduced in an effort to make the game easier to play. Initially, all movements became subject to a vote: all inputs received over a period of time (usually 30 seconds) were tallied, and the winning command would be executed at the end of that time. Users could also append their movements with numbers to specify the length of the motion, such as &quot;right3&quot; to mean three consecutive &quot;right&quot; inputs. Many people were outraged over this new system and protest broke out in the Twitch chat, many of them using the command &quot;start9&quot; (which would open and close the pause menu nine times to slow down progress) to fight the system. The broadcaster later reworked the mechanic so that users could vote to switch between two modes: &quot;Anarchy&quot;, the previous default, and this new mode &quot;Democracy.&quot; However, a change to Democracy mode requires a supermajority vote, while a change to Anarchy mode requires only a majority vote, as indicated by an on-screen meter. This change was considered divisive by players, who believed that Democracy mode conflicted with the original concept of the stream and eliminated the potential for randomness which had helped to drive the elaborate narrative and mythology that had built up around the playthrough.</p>
<p>Following the completion of <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Red</i>, a new game began on 2 March 2014, this time with the second generation game <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Crystal</i>. The developer set a deadline for the completion of <i>Crystal</i> with the plan to start <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Emerald</i> on a fixed date, though the players were able to complete <i>Crystal</i> well before this point. With the change to <i>Crystal</i> also came a change to the voting system; the Democracy mode was automatically activated at the top of each hour. By 14 March 2014, players had reached a major battle on Mt. Silver against Red, a trainer representing the player-character from <i>Red</i> and <i>Blue</i>; however, the game was also modified so that Red&apos;s team would consist of the same Pok&#xE9;mon that were used to beat the Elite Four in the Twitch Plays <i>Pok&#xE9;mon</i> playthrough of <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Red</i> earlier. The developer stated that he intentionally changed the game data of <i>Crystal</i> to behave in this way, as it was Game Freak&apos;s original intent when creating the game that the player would face Red in <i>Crystal</i> using the Pok&#xE9;mon they had finished <i>Red</i> with. <i>Crystal</i> was beaten on 15 March, with more than 13 days of playtime. The developer stated that even though fewer viewers watched <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Crystal</i> compared to <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Red</i>, he will continue the stream with other <i>Pok&#xE9;mon</i> games as long as there remains interest in the experiment.</p>
<p><i>Pok&#xE9;mon Emerald</i> was started on 21 March 2014. With the shift to <i>Emerald,</i> the Democracy mode was initially disabled entirely. <i>Emerald</i> was repeatedly restarted due to its soft reset ability, but was later fixed by the broadcaster.</p>
<p>The shift to <i>Pok&#xE9;mon X</i>&#x2014;the 1st installment in the franchise for the Nintendo 3DS, brought changes to the stream&apos;s setup. As there was no PC-based emulator for the 3DS at the time, the stream was conducted on actual 3DS hardware using a hardware modification known as the 3DS Streaming Console with External Control Interface (3xtDS); developed by Reddit user dekuNukem, also known as Twitch_plays_3ds (who has also designed an automated rig for &quot;chaining&quot; and detecting &quot;shiny&quot; Pok&#xE9;mon), the mod allows direct control of inputs on the device via an USB-based interface, and added the video output required for capturing the screens&apos; content. The change to native hardware also allowed the stream to use the Wi-Fi capabilities of the device; other players of <i>Pok&#xE9;mon X</i> and <i>Y</i> could directly interact with the stream&apos;s player via Nintendo Network and the game&apos;s internet-enabled features, such as online battles, trades, and O-Powers. Following its release, <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Omega Ruby</i> was also played in the stream.</p>
<p>In honour of the one-year anniversary of the original run, a new playing of <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Red</i> began in February 2015. The goal was to complete the game&apos;s main storyline and to catch all 151 Pok&#xE9;mon, the latter which they did in around 39 days.</p>


<p>Launched on 12 February 2014 as a &quot;proof of concept&quot;, the stream was relatively inactive for the first day and a half of playing. However, the stream quickly went viral after that, reaching a total viewership of around 175,000 by 14 February (when players managed to beat the first of eight Gym leaders). By 17 February, the channel had reached over 6.5&#xA0;million total views. By 20 February, the channel had over 17&#xA0;million total views, and was averaging concurrent viewership between 60 and 70&#xA0;thousand viewers with at least 10% participating. By then, the players had managed to catch 12 different species of Pok&#xE9;mon, and made it past the fourth gym. On the completion of <i>Red</i>, the channel had reached 36&#xA0;million total views, with a peak concurrent viewership of 120,000, and an estimated 658,000 had participated. The <i>Red</i> stream was eventually recognized by the <i>Guinness World Records</i> for having &quot;the most participants on a single-player online videogame&quot; with 1,165,140. The large amount of activity on the stream resulted in &quot;enormous (and unforeseen) stress&quot; on Twitch&apos;s chat system, requiring the site&apos;s engineers to move the stream&apos;s chat to a higher-capacity server normally used during major e-sports events, while working on improving the infrastructure&apos;s scalability. The developer himself said, &quot;I didn&apos;t think it was going to be this popular, I thought it would gain only a small group of dedicated viewers and many others would check it out briefly before moving on to other things. It&apos;s overwhelming how popular it has become.&quot;</p>
<p>An active community of players also emerged on communities and social networks such as Reddit, which have liveblogged the proceedings and developed memes and other works around occurrences in the game. One item in Red&apos;s inventory from the start of the game was the Helix Fossil, which was used later in the game to revive Omanyte, but is otherwise functionless. The Helix Fossil was selected so frequently that it became an inside joke among players, and at times humorously calling it a deity which the player-character was constantly consulting for advice, and it quickly became the player&apos;s &quot;religion&quot;. Players went as far as treating the fossil as a symbol representing a sect which supports Anarchy mode, while treating its counterpart, the Dome Fossil (which revives Kabuto), as a deity to those who support Democracy mode. Certain Pok&#xE9;mon captured by Red during the gameplay have also gained fan followings. Two Pok&#xE9;mon that were obtained early in the game, and then later accidentally released were the Charmeleon and Rattata, &quot;ABBBBBBK(&quot; and &quot;JLVWNNOOOO&quot;, further nicknamed &quot;Abby&quot; and &quot;Jay Leno&quot;. The team&apos;s Pidgeot, one of the highest level Pok&#xE9;mon in the group and often successful in battles, was named &quot;Bird Jesus&quot; by the community; concurrently, the team&apos;s Zapdos was nicknamed &quot;AA-j&quot; but referred to as &quot;Archangel of Justice&quot; or &quot;Anarchy Bird&quot;. Their Flareon was dubbed the &quot;False Prophet&quot;, as players had accidentally obtained it instead of Vaporeon, which was needed so they could teach it the &quot;Surf&quot; move needed to travel on water, and it had later caused the release of the Charmeleon and Rattata. During the eleventh day of the event (23 February), which fell on a Sunday, the players inadvertently released a dozen of the captured Pok&#xE9;mon, effectively deleting the creatures from the game, an event that later became known as &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;. The practice of nicknames continued into <i>Crystal</i>, which included a new Pidgeot nicknamed &quot;Brian&quot;, and a Feraligatr nicknamed &quot;Lazorgator&quot;.</p>

<p>Media outlets have described the proceedings of the game as being &quot;mesmerizing,&quot; &quot;miraculous,&quot; and &quot;beautiful chaos,&quot; with one viewer comparing it to &quot;watching a car crash in slow motion.&quot; Ars Technica felt that it encapsulated &quot;the best and worst qualities of our user-driven, novelty-hungry age,&quot; providing hours of arguable time-wasting entertainment through a word-of-mouth viral distribution. The stream has been compared to the infinite monkey theorem in that effectively random input to a game still ultimately comes out with forward progress in the game. Twitch vice president of marketing Matthew DiPietro praised the stream, considering it &quot;one more example of how video games have become a platform for entertainment and creativity that extends WAY beyond the original intent of the game creator. By merging a video game, live video and a participatory experience, the broadcaster has created an entertainment hybrid custom made for the Twitch community. This is a wonderful proof on concept that we hope to see more of in the future.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Twitch Plays Pok&#xE9;mon</i> has also inspired imitators with other video games, such as <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Blue</i>, <i>QWOP</i>, <i>Tetris</i> (including one which used the actual command inputs from the original Twitch Plays <i>Pok&#xE9;mon</i> stream), <i>Street Fighter II</i>, <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i> (itself made significantly difficult by its nature as a first-person shooter), <i>Metal Gear: Ghost Babel</i>, <i>Dark Souls</i>, <i>Fallout 3</i>, and <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Go</i> (which used location spoofing to simulate the movement of a real person in response to viewers&apos; commands). Similar Twitch Plays have been used for taking care of a virtual pet Tamagotchi, and installing Arch Linux onto a virtual machine through text commands entered one letter at a time.</p>
<p>The term &quot;crowdplay&quot; has been ascribed to similar games where the actions of the crowd directly influence the gameplay. tinyBuild Games used the &quot;Twitch Plays&quot; model to release <i>Punch Club</i>, holding back release of the game until either a preset date or completion of the game running via a public &quot;Twitch Plays&quot; stream. <i>Punch Club</i> later added the ability for viewers to bet on in-game fights using virtual <i>Twitch.tv</i> currency, following a similar betting model used by Oxeye Game Systems for <i>Cobalt</i>. Telltale Games premiered a new &quot;crowd play&quot; feature for its adventure games starting with its 2016 <i>Batman</i> game, allowing stream viewers to vote on selected decisions within the game. In January 2016, Twitch created a specialized directory for various &quot;Twitch Plays&quot; streams, with their VP of Developer Success Kathy Astromoff stating that the company has recognized the growth of similar experiments, and enabling such experiments to be easily found by its userbase. Further, in March 2016, Twitch announced a new &quot;stream first&quot; initiative to help developer create games that are aimed for integration of streaming and chat atop more traditional gameplay, basing the format on the prior success of <i>Twitch Plays Pokemon</i> streams. Amazon.com, which acquired Twitch in 2014, developed the Amazon Lumberyard game engine that includes direct support for Twitch streaming to allow viewers to influence games via the associated chat, taking cues from the popularity of &quot;Twitch Plays&quot;.</p>
<p>Another homage, Fish Plays <i>Pok&#xE9;mon</i>, surfaced in August 2014 as part of a HackNY hackathon. The stream, which consists of a fishcam in which the position of a betta fish in a fish bowl is used to control <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Red</i>, peaked around 20,000 concurrent viewers.</p>
<p>A Helix Fossil emote with the shortcut &quot;PraiseIt&quot; was later made available as a Twitch chat emote in celebration of the original Pok&#xE9;mon Red run.</p>

<p>From <i>Platinum</i> to <i>Black 2</i>, the stream showed a second game, <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Stadium 2</i>, alongside the main game. Unlike other games, inputs for Stadium 2 were chosen at random and were not controlled by the chat. Instead, players on the chat were given virtual currency that could be used to place bets on the outcome of Stadium 2 matches. After <i>Pok&#xE9;mon X</i> concluded on 1 August 2014, a similar system was implemented, with <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Battle Revolution</i> taking the place of Stadium 2, as it added more features such as better graphics. This time, instead of inputs being entirely random, players who bet on the current match could vote on which move would be used by their team each turn; the system would randomly choose one of the bettors&apos; choices, but players who had placed higher bets had a higher chance of their move being chosen. The developer has created a modded version of <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Battle Revolution</i> known as <i>Pok&#xE9;mon Battle Revolution 2.0</i>. It is meant to fix glitches and add various improvements such as additional battle arenas. During the interim, the stream showed <i>Harvest Moon GB</i>, <i>Pokk&#xE9;n Tournament</i>, <i>EarthBound</i>, <i>Robopon Sun</i>, and save states of the first four runs in reverse order.</p>
