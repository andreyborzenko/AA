<h1>Chuck Norris facts</h1>
<p><b>Chuck Norris facts</b> are satirical factoids about martial artist and actor Chuck Norris that have become an Internet phenomenon and as a result have become widespread in popular culture. The &apos;facts&apos; are normally absurd hyperbolic claims about Norris&apos; toughness, attitude, virility, sophistication, and masculinity.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris facts have spread around the world, leading not only to translated versions, but also spawning localized versions mentioning country-specific advertisements and other Internet phenomena. Allusions are also sometimes made to his use of roundhouse kicks to perform seemingly any task, his large amount of body hair with specific regard to his beard, and his role in the action television series <i>Walker, Texas Ranger</i>.</p>




<p>Chuck Norris facts originally started appearing on the Internet in early 2005. Initially distributed in the Something Awful forums, the &quot;facts&quot; centered on Vin Diesel, in response to his film <i>The Pacifier</i>. After a few months, forum members chose Chuck Norris to be the new subject. Conan O&apos;Brien&apos;s Chuck Norris jokes on <i>Late Night with Conan O&apos;Brien</i> (which generally center on <i>Walker, Texas Ranger</i>) have been seen as an inspiration for the fad. The exaggerated style of these claims is similar to a recurring <i>Saturday Night Live</i> sketch called &quot;Bill Brasky&quot;. Due to the popularity of this phenomenon, similar jokes have been created for various other celebrities, as well as fictional characters.</p>
