<h1>Jay Maynard</h1>

<p><b>Jay Maynard</b> (born July 27, 1960) is an American computer programmer and system administrator and the volunteer project maintainer for Hercules, a free emulator of IBM mainframe hardware. He is known for his self-made electroluminescent costume based on the film <i>Tron</i>, which resulted in his nickname <b>Tron Guy</b>.</p>




<p>Maynard created a revealing electroluminescent costume, inspired by the film <i>Tron</i>, that he could wear at the science fiction convention Penguicon in 2004. He has said that he &quot;hasn&apos;t missed a Penguicon, and doesn&apos;t intend to&quot;. He created a web page of photos of the costume, and of himself wearing it. His page of photos quickly gained a lot of attention on the Internet, after it was posted on Slashdot and Fark.</p>
<p>He was invited for a series of appearances on the late-night talk show <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i> in 2004.</p>
<p>In 2006, Maynard appeared in a music video entitled &quot;We Are the Web&quot;, for the website of the same name. The video advocates the concept of network neutrality. In it, Maynard appears alongside several other Internet celebrities, including Leslie Hall and Randy Constan. He was also parodied in the 2008 <i>South Park</i> episode &quot;Canada on Strike&quot;. His likeness appeared alongside those of such other Internet celebrities as Gary Brolsma, Star Wars Kid, Chris Crocker, and Tay Zonday.</p>
<p>In 2009, Maynard was the focus of the &quot;Web Redemption&quot; segment on an episode of the TV series <i>Tosh.0</i>; in this segment, an Internet celebrity answers both serious and mocking questions from host Daniel Tosh, then re-enacts their original act.</p>
<p>In 2010, Maynard was banned from seeing the film <i>Tron: Legacy</i> in his iconic Tron suit in his local movie theater because of the illuminating lights on his suit.</p>
<p>On June 8, 2011, Maynard appeared on <i>America&apos;s Got Talent</i>. He received a &quot;no&quot; vote from all of the three judges and did not make it past the audition round. Howie Mandel had him restart his introductory speech over several times, so it was left unclear what his act was going to be.</p>
<p>In 2011, Maynard appeared in Duck Products&apos; &quot;Stuck On Duck Video Project&quot;, a commercial for duct tape. The ad, made by Ryactive and produced by Tongal, recreates the light-cycle race from <i>Tron</i> using stop-motion animation, followed by Maynard&apos;s appearance in the Tron Guy outfit. The video was featured in <i>Wired Magazine</i> as a &quot;genius idea&quot; and like many of Maynard&apos;s previous videos went viral, becoming the tenth most viewed video of all time on Vimeo.</p>
<p>On August 26, 2015, Maynard was interviewed by the <i>Scene World Podcast</i> in a live video podcast, hosted by Olympronica for the Film &amp; Games Interactions exhibit at the Deutsches Filminstitut in Frankfurt, Germany. The interview was presented live on Twitch.tv, and later published as both a video interview on YouTube and audio podcast.</p>
