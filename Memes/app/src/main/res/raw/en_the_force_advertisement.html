<h1>The Force (advertisement)</h1>
<p><i><b>The Force</b></i> is a television advertisement created by Donny Deutsch Advertising Inc. (Deutsch) to promote Volkswagen&apos;s Passat.</p>




<p>Volkswagen had not aired a commercial during the Super Bowl in more than 10 years, but in 2011, the company ran two ads, both from advertising agency Deutsch. The other was called &quot;Black Beetle&quot;.</p>
<p>The advertisement for the 2012 Volkswagen Passat, created by Eric Springer, Michael Kadin, Ryan Mclaughlin, Craig Melchiano and David Povill at Deutsch, features a young boy (played by Max Page) in full Darth Vader regalia attempting to use The Force to start a washing machine a clothes dryer, and to wake the dog and a doll. After he is unsuccessful in those attempts, he is startled to discover that he can start the car, though his father actually does it using a remote control.</p>
<p>The film was directed by Lance Acord and produced by Park Pictures featuring the musical track &quot;Imperial March&quot; composed by John Williams.</p>


<p>Max Page had never seen any of the <i>Star Wars</i> movies, saying he was too scared. He met James Earl Jones, the voice of Vader in the <i>Star Wars</i> movies, in New York City on February 7. On May 24, Page appeared in costume, with the Star Wars Darth Vader music playing, at the inauguration of the Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant.</p>
<p>In addition, Page played Reed Hellstrom on the American TV soap opera <i>The Young and the Restless</i> starting November 24, 2009, appeared in local commercials, and has acted &quot;since he was barely able to walk&quot;.</p>
<p>When he was three months old, Page had life-saving surgery, and soon after that received a pacemaker to treat a heart disorder called Tetralogy of Fallot. Children&apos;s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) cardiology chief Michael Silka said, &quot;He can essentially have normal activity and with careful care, a full life is a reasonable expectation.&quot; Page, at age 7, had another corrective open-heart surgery at CHLA on June 14, 2012. He received a valve expected to last 15 years.</p>

<p>Kovar McClure, an American-born actor, plays the father in the spot.</p>

<p>The Passat ad appeared on YouTube the week before its TV debut on February 6, 2011. By the next morning, the video had received one million views; the number reached 8 million before the commercial aired on TV. Considered by everyone connected with the ad to be the best version but &quot;too long to play during the game&quot;, the online version lasted sixty seconds, compared to thirty in the broadcast version, and the long version stood out more in people&apos;s minds. As of February 7, the video had more than 15 million views. Page&apos;s mother, Jennifer, said the reaction was &quot;overwhelming. ... I can&apos;t even keep up with the messages and the calls.&quot;</p>
<p>James Rainey of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> said the ad &quot;will get inside people&apos;s heads and stay there because it combines the iconic &apos;Star Wars&apos; character and a classic sentiment&#x2014;a child&apos;s desire to be larger than life.&quot; Of all the Super Bowl ads, Rainey said, &quot;the one you&apos;ll actually want to see again is Volkswagen&apos;s, powered by the force of a tiny Darth Vader who tells a simple story, with a little body language and nary a word.&quot;</p>
<p>Stuart Elliott of <i>The New York Times</i> enjoyed the ad, calling it a &quot;loving spot-on tribute to Star Wars.&quot; CNBC&apos;s Phil LeBeau said that the commercial was &quot;clever, original&quot; and &quot;left a strong lasting impression.&quot; According to <i>USA Today</i> the commercial was posted online 5 days before the Super Bowl and had already garnered 13 million views by the time the game aired. It also scored number 3 on the <i>USA Today</i> Ad Meter.</p>
<p>On May 23, the Passat ad won an online competition on the CBS special <i>Clash of the Commercials: USA vs. the World</i>, in which people were asked to &quot;choose the greatest commercial of all time.&quot; The second-place finisher was Heineken&apos;s &quot;Walk-in Fridge&quot;.</p>
<p>By the end of 2011, <i>Advertising Age</i> said, &quot;With 600 placements, the video is on pace to become one of the most-watched viral ads of all time.&quot; In its first year the ad had over 49.4&#xA0;million views. The video is also the most shared ad of all-time.</p>
<p>As of August 2014, the Passat ad had 5,254,667 on social media when it was surpassed after 41 months as the most shared ad by &quot;La La La (Brazil 2014)&quot; for Activia. It remained in second place and was still the most shared Super Bowl ad as of January 2015, when it had 61 million views.</p>
<p>The success of the Passat ad is considered to have changed how Super Bowl advertising is viewed. Instead of a single ad, businesses look at an entire campaign which involves previews before the game and the use of social media.</p>
