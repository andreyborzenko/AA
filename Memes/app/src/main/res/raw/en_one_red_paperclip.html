<h1>One red paperclip</h1>

<p>The website <b>One red paperclip</b> was created by Canadian blogger Kyle MacDonald, who bartered his way from a single red paperclip to a house in a series of fourteen online trades over the course of a year. MacDonald was inspired by the childhood game <i>Bigger, Better</i>. His site received a considerable amount of notice for tracking the transactions. &quot;A lot of people have been asking how I&apos;ve stirred up so much publicity around the project, and my simple answer is: &apos;I have no idea&quot;, he told the BBC.</p>




<p>MacDonald made his first trade, a red paper clip for a fish-shaped pen, on July 14, 2005. He reached his goal of trading up to a house with the fourteenth transaction, trading a movie role for a house. This is the list of all transactions MacDonald made:</p>
<ol>
<li>On July 14, 2005, he went to Vancouver and traded the paperclip for a fish-shaped pen.</li>
<li>He then traded the pen the same day for a hand-sculpted doorknob from Seattle, Washington.</li>
<li>On July 25, 2005, he travelled to Amherst, Massachusetts, with a friend to trade the doorknob for a Coleman camp stove (with fuel).</li>
<li>On September 24, 2005, he went to California, and traded the camp stove for a Honda generator.</li>
<li>On November 16, 2005, he made a second (and successful) attempt (after having the generator confiscated by the New York City Fire Department) in Maspeth, Queens, to trade the generator for an &quot;instant party&quot;: an empty keg, an IOU for filling the keg with the beer of the bearer&apos;s choice, and a neon Budweiser sign.

</li>
<li>On December 8, 2005, he traded the &quot;instant party&quot; to Quebec comedian and radio personality Michel Barrette for one Ski-Doo snowmobile.</li>
<li>Within a week of that, he traded the snowmobile for a two-person trip to Yahk, British Columbia, in February 2006.</li>
<li>On or about January 7, 2006, he traded the second spot on the Yahk trip for a box truck.</li>
<li>On or about February 22, 2006, he traded the box truck for a recording contract with Metalworks in Mississauga, Ontario.</li>
<li>On or about April 11, 2006, he traded the recording contract to Jody Gnant for a year&apos;s rent in Phoenix, Arizona.</li>
<li>On or about April 26, 2006, he traded the one year&apos;s rent in Phoenix, Arizona, for one afternoon with Alice Cooper.</li>
<li>On or about May 26, 2006, he traded the one afternoon with Alice Cooper for a KISS motorized snow globe.</li>
<li>On or about June 2, 2006, he traded the KISS motorized snow globe to Corbin Bernsen for a role in the film <i>Donna on Demand</i>.</li>
<li>On or about July 5, 2006, he traded the movie role for a two-story farmhouse in Kipling, Saskatchewan.</li>
