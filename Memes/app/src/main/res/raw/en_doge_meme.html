<h1>Doge (meme)</h1>
<p><b>Doge</b> (often pronounced   or  ) is an Internet meme that became popular in 2013. The meme typically consists of a picture of a Shiba Inu accompanied by multicolored text in Comic Sans font in the foreground. The text, representing a kind of internal monologue, is deliberately written in a form of broken English.</p>
<p>The meme is based on a 2010 photograph, and became popular in late 2013, being named as <i>Know Your Meme&apos;</i>s &quot;top meme&quot; of that year. A cryptocurrency based on Doge, the Dogecoin, was launched in December 2013, and the Shiba Inu is featured on Josh Wise&apos;s NASCAR car as part of a sponsorship deal. Doge has also been referenced by members of the United States Congress, a safety video for Delta Air Lines, a Google Easter egg, and the video for the song &quot;Word Crimes&quot; by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic.</p>




<p>Doge uses two-word phrases in which the first word is almost always one of five modifiers (&quot;so&quot;, &quot;such&quot;, &quot;many&quot;, &quot;much&quot;, and &quot;very&quot;), and the departure from correct English is to use the modifier with a word that it cannot properly modify. For example, &quot;Much respect. So noble.&quot; uses the doge modifiers but is not &quot;proper&quot; doge because the modifiers are used in a formally correct fashion; the doge version would be &quot;Much noble, so respect.&quot; In addition to these phrases, a doge utterance often ends with a single word, most often &quot;wow&quot; but with &quot;amaze&quot; and &quot;excite&quot; also being used.</p>

<p>Kabosu , the female Shiba Inu featured in the original meme, was a pedigree puppy who was sent to an animal shelter when her puppy mill shut down. She was adopted in 2008 by Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Sat&#x14D;, and named after the citrus fruit Kabosu because Sato thought she had a round face like the fruit. Another Shiba Inu featured in the meme is Suki, a female belonging to photographer Jonathan Fleming from San Francisco. His wife had accidentally put a scarf in the wash, making it shrink. He took a photograph of Suki wearing the scarf outside on a cold night in February 2010.</p>
<p>Kabosu was first pictured in a 2010 blog post by Sato; afterwards, variations of the pictures using overlaid Comic Sans text were posted from a Tumblr blog, <i>Shiba Confessions</i>. However, the use of the intentionally misspelled &quot;doge&quot; dates back to June 2005, when it was mentioned in an episode of <i>Homestar Runner</i>s puppet series.</p>
<p>The most common pronunciations of &quot;doge&quot; are   and  . In non-English speaking countries, &quot;doge&quot; is occasionally pronounced  . Those unfamiliar or unacquainted with the meme also use the pronunciations  ,  ,  , or simply  .</p>

<p>In August 2013, images of the meme were spammed on Reddit&apos;s r/MURICA subreddit by 4chan&apos;s random imageboard, /b/. Online searches for the meme began to increase in July 2013. Google later created a Doge Easter egg: when <i>doge meme</i> was entered into the YouTube search bar, all the site&apos;s text would be displayed in colorful Comic Sans, similar to the kind used by the meme.</p>
<p>The meme was ranked at No. 12 on MTV&apos;s list of &quot;50 Things Pop Culture Had Us Giving Thanks For&quot; in 2013. Io9 compared the internal dialog of the Shiba Inu dogs to lolspeak. On December 13, Doge was named the &quot;top meme&quot; of 2013 by Know Your Meme.</p>
<p>In late December 2013, members of the U.S. Congress produced material in the meme&apos;s style. <i>The Huffington Post</i> commented that Doge was &quot;killed&quot; because of the Congress members&apos; usage of the meme.</p>
<p>In December 2013, the Dogecoin was introduced as a new cryptocurrency, making it the first cryptocurrency to be based on an Internet meme; the viral phenomenon, along with usage of the Comic Sans MS typeface, gave it &quot;the Internet density of a large star&quot; according to Medium writer Quinn Norton. By early 2014, Doge&apos;s popularity was sustained by internet communities on social media, accompanied by the rapid growth and acceptance of Dogecoin. In April 2014, Doge experienced a second major media resurgence due to revelations of the Dogecoin community&apos;s intent to sponsor Josh Wise in NASCAR and place a picture of the Shiba Inu on his vehicle. The car features in downloadable content for the video game <i>NASCAR &apos;14</i>. Media outlets have embraced the meme while reporting on the cryptocurrency and the car, with titles featuring phrases such as &quot;so wow&quot; and &quot;very vroom&quot;.</p>
<p>In January 2014, Sydney-based web developers Katia Eirin and Bennett Wong created <i>Doge Weather</i>, a weather website and mobile app incorporating the meme. <i>Doge Weather</i> reports the temperature and weather conditions based on the user&apos;s geographic location. In April 2014, <i>Doge Weather</i> became available as a mobile app for iOS 7 costing 99&#xA2;.</p>

<p>In mid-2014, the advertisement agency DDB Stockholm had Doge feature prominently in an advertising campaign for the public transport company SL in Stockholm, Sweden. The advertisement concerned the company&apos;s special summer tickets, and featured Doge holding a public transport ticket in his mouth, with phrases such as &quot;many summer&quot;, &quot;such cheap&quot; and &quot;very buy&quot;. Doge was also one of 25 Internet memes featured in a Delta Air Lines safety video released in May 2015. In the video for &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&apos;s 2014 song &quot;Word Crimes&quot;, a song about bad grammar, a Doge tweet is used to illustrate the types of bad grammar referenced in that part of the song.</p>
<p>&quot;Doge&quot; was one of several additions to Dictionary.com in November 2015. The website defines it as not just the image macro and its variants, but also the form of &quot;language&quot; that it utilizes.</p>
<p>The Japanese perception is remarkably different; Sat&#x14D; and Kabosu are rather known as a pet and owner rather than a meme, and her blog is the fourth-most popular pet-related blog in the country as of December 2013. Reacting to the meme, she explained, &quot;To be honest, some pictures are strange for me, but it&apos;s still funny! I&#x2019;m very impressed with their skills and taste. Around me, nobody knows about the doge meme. Maybe I don&apos;t understand memes very well, because I&apos;m living a such an analog life.&quot; Sat&#x14D; has also expressed that she had learned that &quot;the risk of the internet is that anyone in the world can see my life on my blog&quot;. Fleming stated that in his experience, the Shiba Inu breed has become more recognised due to the meme.</p>
