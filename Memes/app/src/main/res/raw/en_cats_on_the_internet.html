<h1>Cats and the Internet</h1>
<p>Images and videos of domestic cats make up some of the most viewed content on the web, particularly image macros in the form of lolcats. ThoughtCatalog has described cats as the &quot;unofficial mascot of the Internet.&quot; Cats as human companions &quot;are now sharing not only people&apos;s real life but also their virtual world.&quot; as a scientific study points out. </p>
<p>The subject has attracted the attention of various scholars and critics, who have analysed why this form of low art has reached iconic status. Though it may be considered frivolous, cat-related internet content contributes to how people interact with media and culture. Some argue that there is a depth and complexity to this seemingly simple content, with a suggestion that the positive psychological effects that pet animals have on their owners also holds true for cat images viewed online.</p>
<p>Some individual cats, such as Grumpy Cat and Lil Bub, have achieved popularity online because of their unusual appearances.</p>




<p>Humans have always had a close relationship with cats, and the animals have long been a subject of short films, including the early silent movies <i></i> (1894) and <i>The Sick Kitten</i> (1903).  (1822&#x2013;1889) has been cited as the &quot;progenitor of the shameless cat picture&quot;. Cats have been shared via email since the internet&apos;s inception in the 1990s. The first cat video on YouTube was uploaded in 2005 by YouTube co-founder Steve Chen, who posted a video of his cat called Pyjamas playing with a rope&quot;. The following year, &quot;Puppy vs Cat&quot; became the first viral cat video; uploaded by a user called Sanchey; as of 2015 it had over 16 million views on YouTube. In a Mashable article that explored the history of cat media on the Internet, the oldest entry was an ASCII art cat that originated on 2channel, and was a pictorial representation of the phrase &quot;Please go away.&quot;</p>
<p><i>The New York Times</i> described cat images as &quot;that essential building block of the Internet&quot;. In addition, 2,594,329 cat images had been manually annotated in flickr.com by users. An interesting phenomenon is that many photograph owners tag their house cats as &#x201C;tiger&quot;.</p>
<p>Eric Nakagawa and Kari Unebasami started the website I Can Haz Cheezburger in 2007, where they shared funny pictures of cats. This site allowed users to create LOLcat memes by placing writing on top of pictures of their cats. This site now has more than 100 million views per month and has &quot;created a whole new form of internet speak&quot;. In 2009, the humour site Urlesque deemed September 9 &quot;A Day Without Cats Online&quot;, and had over 40 blogs and websites agree to &quot;[ban] cats from their pages for at least 24 hours&quot;. As of 2015, there are over 2 million cat videos on YouTube alone, and cats are one of the most searched keywords on the internet. CNN estimated that in 2015 there could be around 6.5 billion cat pictures on the internet. The internet has been described as a &quot;virtual cat park, a social space for cat lovers in the same way that dog lovers congregate at a dog park.&quot; <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> deemed Nyan Cat the most popular internet cat, while NPR gave this title to Grumpy Cat. <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> also deemed the best cat video on YouTube as &quot;Surprised Kitty (Original)&quot;, which currently has over 75 million views. Buzzfeed deemed  the most important cat of 2010.</p>
<p>In 2015, an exhibition called &quot;How Cats Took Over The Internet&quot; opened at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York. The exhibition &quot;looks at the history of how they rose to internet fame, and why people like them so much.&quot; There is even a book entitled <i>How to Make Your Cat an Internet Celebrity: A Guide to Financial Freedom</i>. The annual Internet Cat Video Festival celebrated and awards the Golden Kitty to cat videos. According to <i>Star Tribune</i>, the festival&apos;s success is because &quot;people realized that the cat video they&#x2019;d chuckled over in the privacy of their homes was suddenly a thousand times funnier when there are thousands of other people around&quot;. <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> had an entire article devoted to International Cat Day. EMGN wrote an article entitled &quot;21 Reasons Why Cats And The Internet Are A Match Made in Heaven&quot;.</p>
<p>In 2015, there were more than 2 million cat videos on YouTube, with an average of 12,000 views each &#x2013; a higher average than any other category of YouTube content. Cats made up 16% of views in YouTube&apos;s &quot;Pets &amp; Animals&quot; category, compared to dogs&apos; 23%. The YouTube video <i>Cats vs. Zombies</i> merged the two internet phenomena of cats and zombies. Data from BuzzFeed and Tumblr has shown that dog videos have more views than those of cats, and less than 1% of posts on Reddit mention cats. While dogs are searched for much more than cats, there is less content on the internet. The Facebook page &quot;Cats&quot; has over 2 million likes while Dogs has over 6.5 million. In an Internet tradition, <i>The New York Times</i> Archives Twitter account posts cat reporting throughout the history of the NYT. The Japanese prefecture of Hiroshima launched an online Cat Street View, which showed the region from the perspective of a cat.</p>
<p>Abigail Tucker, author of <i>The Lion in the Living Room</i>, a history of domestic cats, has suggested that cats appeal particularly because they &quot;remind us of own faces, and especially of our babies...[they&apos;re] strikingly human but also perpetually deadpan.&quot;</p>

<p>Jason Eppink, curator of the Museum of the Moving Image&apos;s show <i>How Cats Took Over the Internet</i>, has noted the &quot;outsized role&quot; of cats on the Internet. Wired magazine felt that the cuteness of cats was &quot;too simplistic&quot; an explanation of their popularity online.</p>
<p>A scientific survey done found that the participants were more happy after watching cat videos. The researcher behind the survey explained &quot;If we want to better understand the effects the Internet may have on us as individuals and on society, then researchers can&apos;t ignore Internet cats anymore&quot; and &quot;consumption of online cat-related media deserves empirical attention&quot;. The Huffington Post suggested that the videos were a form of procrastination, with most being watched while at work or ostensibly studying, while IU Bloomington commented &quot;[it] does more than simply entertain; it boosts viewers&apos; energy and positive emotions and decreases negative feelings&quot;. BusinessInsider argues &quot;This falls in line with a body of research regarding the effects that animals have on people.&quot; A 2015 study by Jessica Gall Myrick found that people were more than twice as likely to post a picture or video of a cat to the internet than they were to post a selfie. Also, it was found that people who watch cat videos feel more energetic and positive after viewing online cat content.</p>
<p> considers cat videos to be &quot;the crystallisation of all that human beings love about cats&quot;, with their &quot;natural beauty and majesty&quot; being &quot;just one tiny slip away from total humiliation&quot;, which Bustillos sees as a mirror of the human condition. When the creator of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, was asked for an example of a popular use of the internet that he would never had predicted, he answered &quot;Kittens&quot;. A 2014 paper argues that cats&apos; &quot;unselfconsciousness&quot; is rare in an age of hyper-surveillance, and cat photos appeal to people as it lets them imagine &quot;the possibility of freedom from surveillance&quot;, while presenting the power of controlling that surveillance as unproblematic. Time magazine felt that cat images tap into viewers nature as &quot;secret voyeurs&quot;.</p>
<p>The Cheezburger Network considers cats to be the &quot;perfect canvas&quot; for human emotion, as they have expressive facial and body aspects. Mashable offered &quot;cats&apos; cuteness, non-cuteness, popularity among geeks, blank canvas qualities, personality issues, and the fact that dogs just don&apos;t have &quot;it&quot;&quot; as possible explanations to cats&apos; popularity on the internet. A paper entitled &quot;<i>&#x201C;I Can Haz Emoshuns?&#x201D; &#x2013; Understanding Anthropomorphosis of Cats among Internet Users</i>&quot; found that Tagpuss, an app that showed users cat images and asked them to choose their emotion &quot;can be used to identify cat behaviours that lay-people find difficult to distinguish&quot;.</p>
<p>Jason Eppink, curator of the &#x201C;How Cats Took Over the Internet&#x201D; exhibition, explained: &#x201C;People on the web are more likely to post a cat than another animal, because it sort of perpetuates itself. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy.&#x201D; Jason Kottke considers cats to be &quot;easier to objectify&quot; and therefore &quot;easier to make fun of&quot;. Journalist  suggested that cats were more popular than dogs because dogs were &quot;trying too hard&quot;, and humorous behavior in a dog would be seen as a bid for validation. Shepherd sees cats&apos; behavior as being &quot;cool, and effortless, and devoid of any concern about what you might think about it. It is art for art&apos;s sake.&quot;</p>
<p>Cats have historically been associated with magic, and have been revered by various human cultures, the ancient Egyptians worshipping them as gods and the creatures being feared as demons in ancient Japan, such as the <i>bakeneko</i>. Vogue magazine has suggested that the popularity of cats on the internet is culturally-specific, being popular in North America, Western Europe, and Japan. Other nations favor different animals online, Ugandans sharing images of goats and chickens, Mexicans preferring llamas, and Chinese internet users sharing images of the river crab and grass-mud horse due to double-meanings of their names allowing them to &quot;subvert government Internet censors&quot;. While cats on the internet might be culturally-specific, cat content is increasing in its popularity in various cultures as a scientific study showed by looking at German, English, Italian, and Russian media. </p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cute_cat_theory_of_digital_activism">Cute cat theory of digital activism</span></h3>


<p>The cute cat theory of digital activism is a theory concerning Internet activism, Web censorship, and &quot;cute cats&quot; (a term used for any low-value, but popular online activity) developed by Ethan Zuckerman in 2008. It posits that most people are not interested in activism; instead, they want to use the web for mundane activities, including surfing for pornography and lolcats (&quot;cute cats&quot;). The tools that they develop for that (such as Facebook, Flickr, Blogger, Twitter, and similar platforms) are very useful to social movement activists, who may lack resources to develop dedicated tools themselves. This, in turn, makes the activists more immune to reprisals by governments than if they were using a dedicated activism platform, because shutting down a popular public platform provokes a larger public outcry than shutting down an obscure one.</p>

<p>Because of the relative newness of this industry, most owners of famous cats found themselves stumbling into internet stardom without intentionally planning it.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Grumpy_Cat">Grumpy Cat</span></h3>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Oskar_and_Klaus">Oskar and Klaus</span></h3>
<p>Oskar was born on May 5, 2011 and was an outdoor kitty living on a small farm in the Loess Hills of western Iowa before being adopted by Mick and Bethany Szydlowski on July 11 of that year. They later moved to Nebraska, finally settling in Seattle, Washington. Oskar has a condition called microphthalmia, which means his eyes never fully developed because of genetic abnormalities. Even though he cannot see, Oskar functions perfectly well using his other senses, and is happy and healthy. Many who meet him for the first time don&apos;t even realize he&apos;s completely blind. Oskar&apos;s best friend, &quot;The Klaus,&quot; is a former stray that was adopted in 2006 by the same couple. He, too, lives in Seattle with Oskar, Mick, and Bethany.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nala_Cat">Nala Cat</span></h3>
<p>Nala was adopted at a shelter when she was 5 or 6 months old. The original owners could not take care of the litter Nala was part of. When Nala was adopted, she was the only one of her family still at the shelter. The person who adopted Nala had not planned on adopting a kitten that day, but she picked up Nala who licked her face and it was love at first lick. She had to take her home. Like many shelter kittens, Nala had breathing problems and infections that needed to be taken care of. With loving care and medicine, Nala gained her health and grew up to be strong and healthy, but with short legs. Her owner started an Instagram account to share Nala&apos;s progress and antics with her friends and family, but ended up amassing over a million followers. Subsequently, Nala has starred in many YouTube videos. The owner has used the attention to bring awareness for the need to spay or neuter pets and adopt from shelters instead of buying them from breeders. And only get pets if you plan to keep them for the rest of their lives, giving them the love and attention they need.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Oh_Long_Johnson">Oh Long Johnson</span></h3>

<p>This unnamed cat, first seen in a video shown on <i>America&apos;s Funniest Home Videos</i>, became famous for its growling resembling human speech. In the video, one cat makes aggressive noises at another, its vocalisations resembling &quot;human-like gibberish&quot; that can be interpreted as &quot;Oh my dog. Oh Long John. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Don Piano. Why I eyes ya. All the live long day.&quot; The video first appeared on the Internet in 2006 during a compilation video on YouTube featuring cats producing human-like sounds, and other standalone videos were later uploaded. The full clip shows a second, younger-looking cat in the room, and the cat&apos;s speech pattern was the result of the cat being aggravated by the second cat&apos;s presence and was reacting with fear and annoyance.</p>

Later, Brad O&apos;Farrell, who was the syndication manager of the video website My Damn Channel, obtained Schmidt&apos;s permission to reuse the footage, appending it to the end of a blooper video to &quot;play&quot; that person offstage after the mistake or gaffe in a similar manner as getting the hook in the days of vaudeville. The appending of Schmidt&apos;s video to other blooper and other viral videos became popular, with such videos usually accompanied with the title <i>Play Him Off, Keyboard Cat</i> or a variant. &quot;Keyboard Cat&quot; was ranked No. 2 on Current TV&apos;s list of 50 Greatest Viral Videos.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cats_that_Look_Like_Hitler">Cats that Look Like Hitler</span></h3>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Brussels_Lockdown">Brussels Lockdown</span></h3>
<p>In 2015, the atmosphere among the community of Brussels, Belgium was tense when the city was put under the highest level state of emergency immediately following the Paris attacks, however internet cats were able to cut the tension by taking over the Twitter feed #BrusselsLockdown. The feed was designed to discuss operational details of terrorist raids, but when police asked for a social media blackout the hashtag was overwhelmed by internet users posting pictures of cats to drown out serious discussion and prevent terrorists from gaining any useful information. The use of cat images is a reference to the Level 4 state of emergency: the French word for the number 4, <i>quatre</i>, is pronounced similarly to the word cat in English.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Catloaf">Catloaf</span></h3>
<p>Catloaf refers to a term describing a cat sitting with its paws and tail tucked under its body giving it the appearance of either a loaf of bread, a meatloaf, or a roast chicken or turkey hence its name.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pusheen">Pusheen</span></h3>

<p><i>Bonsai Kitten</i> is a satirical website launched in 2000 that claims to provide instructions on how to grow a kitten in a jar, so as to mold the bones of the kitten into the shape of the jar as the cat grows, much like how a bonsai plant is shaped. It was made by an MIT university student going by the alias of Dr. Michael Wong Chang. The website generated furor after members of the public complained to animal rights organizations, who stated that &quot;while the site&apos;s content may be faked, the issue it is campaigning for may create violence towards animals&quot;, according to the Michigan Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (MSPCA). Although the website in its most recent form was shut down, it still generates (primarily spam) petitions to shut the site down or complain to its ISP. The website has been thoroughly debunked by Snopes.com and The Humane Society of the United States, among other prominent organizations.</p>
