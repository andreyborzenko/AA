<h1>Potato Parcel</h1>
<p><b>Potato Parcel</b> (or <b>PotatoParcel.com</b>) is an American company and website for delivering potatoes with personalized messages, which are limited to 140 characters or one picture.</p>




<p>In January 2014, a similar company Mail A Spud (or MailASpud.com) based in Brooklyn, New York founded by Sean Din began with the mission statement &quot;with the philosophy that everyone could use a potato every now and then.&quot;</p>
<p>PotatoPacket.ca is a direct competitor based in Canada, using Canadian currency and delivering potatoes with personalized messages on them within Canada.</p>
<p>In May 2015, Potato Parcel was founded by mobile app developer Alex Craig, a 24-year-old University of North Texas alum, and was later promoted on Reddit. Originally, Potato Parcel was based in Dallas, Texas. Large potatoes costed $9.99 (or $10) while medium-sized ones $7.99 (or $8). Craig said he would buy the potatoes from the local neighborhood Walmart. Reportedly, profits per month ranged between $10,000 and $13,000. Potato Parcel has proved popular on websites like Twitter.</p>
<p>Neither Mail A Spud nor the company endorses eating the potato due to health concerns. In an email interview with <i>MarketWatch</i>s Kathleen Burke, Craig said &quot;I wanted to create a brand new way of sending a message outside of apps and technology by allowing anyone to send an anonymous message&#x2026;on a potato.&quot; In August 27, 2015, the company was sold to marketplace website Flippa for $42,000. Previously, Flippa bought the viral webite ShipYourEnemiesGlitter.com from creator Matthew Carpentor for $85,000.</p>
<p>In October 2015, Potato Parcel was sold to Bay Area entrepreneur Riad Bekhit for $40,000 and moved to San Bruno, California. Bekhit says he uses a Pilot G2 gel roller pens to write messages. Since the move, new products include Lump of Coal Potato (a potato that is spray-painted black), Potato Pal (a potato with a picture of someone&#x2019;s face), Potato Postcard (a postcard pasted onto a potato), and Spooky Tater (a potato painted to look like a pumpkin). A burlap sack is also available for shipping. In April 2016, Bekhit said profits per month ranged between $20,000 and $25,000. Potato Parcel has expanded shipping to Australia, Canada, Europe, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Potato Parcel also inspired a number of other delivery companies. Another company of the same name based in Australia delivers at the cost of $10 and a message of 15 words or less. Potato Parcel also inspired Brick or Potato, which allows the customer to choose between a brick or potato with a personalized message at the cost of &#xA3;6.99. Potato Messenger, started by two art students Will Richards and Daniel Butson, mailed 1,000 potatoes to Parliament House, Canberra painted and arranged as the rainbow flag to protest for marriage equality in Australia. It also inspired Bananas Gone Wild, founded by electrocardiogram technician Davonte Wilson of Plano, Texas, and Nannergram, founded by Konnor Willison and based in Lehi, Utah, which delivers bananas with personalized messages. There is also Eggplant Mail, which delivers eggplants.</p>
