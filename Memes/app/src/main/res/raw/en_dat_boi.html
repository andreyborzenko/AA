<h1>Dat Boi</h1>
<p><b>Dat Boi</b> is an Internet meme originating from an &quot;Animation Factory&quot; animation of a unicycling Poison Dart Frog. The meme garnered popularity on Tumblr in 2015 before gaining more recognition through Twitter in 2016.</p>

<p>According to Animation Factory employee Ryan Hagen, the frog GIF used in the meme was created by designer Josh Doohen. Before becoming an Internet meme, the image was used in <i>AP Physics 1 Essentials</i>, a textbook published in 2013.</p>
<p>The meme&apos;s name originates from an edited news screenshot and the line of text often used in association with the image (&quot;here come dat boi! o shit waddup!&quot;) was taken from a different meme featuring a computer-animated <i>Pac-Man</i> character. The frog image and its caption were first put together on Facebook, according to <i>Vox</i>.</p>
<p>In May 2016, the &quot;here come dat boi!&quot; caption came under criticism after various Facebook users claimed to find it an &quot;appropriation of African-American Vernacular English.&quot; As a result, certain Facebook groups discouraged use of the meme. <i>The Verge</i> writer Chris Plante referred to the caption in a June article, stating that the Dat Boi image itself was &quot;not enough&quot; and that &quot;it must say something.&quot;</p>
<p>Dat Boi was featured in <i>The Guardian&apos;s</i> &quot;Month in Memes&quot; article for June 2016. Mat Furie, creator of Pepe the Frog, explained in a June 2016 interview with <i>Comic Book Resources</i> that he was &quot;devastated&quot; to find out that Dat Boi had &quot;begun to overshadow Internet Pepe.&quot;</p>
