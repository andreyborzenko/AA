<h1>Thanks Obama</h1><p><b>Thanks Obama</b> is an internet meme first appearing in 2009 as a hashtag (#thanksobama) in a tweet about President Obama&apos;s policies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WTF: U.S. considering national sales tax (ala VAT) #thanksobama.</p>

<p>When the Republicans gained control of the House in the U.S. midterm election of 2010, the meme changed, no longer being used just by frustrated conservatives; a photo of a tired-looking Obama became the background for a meme that blamed Obama for all kinds of societal and economic ills. During that time liberals took the meme up as well, in a satirical reversal.</p>
<p>One notable example came in 2012, when a picture of a man spilling food with the &quot;Thanks Obama&quot; caption was popular. A subreddit was started as well.</p>
<p>By 2015 it seemed the meme had run its course after Obama used it in a Buzzfeed video. Obama himself revived it in 2016, using it to poke fun at his critics and to thank a supporter who, during a speech, yelled out at and thanked him for $2 gas.</p>
