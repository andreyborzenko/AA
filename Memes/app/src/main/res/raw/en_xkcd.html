<h1>Xkcd</h1>
<p><i><b>xkcd</b></i>, sometimes styled <i><b>XKCD</b></i>, is a webcomic created by Randall Munroe. The comic&apos;s tagline describes it as &quot;A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language&quot;. Munroe states on the comic&apos;s website that the name of the comic is not an acronym but &quot;just a word with no phonetic pronunciation&quot;.</p>
<p>The subject matter of the comic varies from statements on life and love to mathematical and scientific in-jokes. Some strips feature simple humor or pop-culture references. Although it has a cast of stick figures, the comic occasionally features landscapes and intricate mathematical patterns such as fractals, graphs and charts. New comics are added three times a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, although on some occasions they have been added every weekday.</p>
<p>Munroe has released two spinoff books from the comic. His 2014 book <i>What If?</i> is based on his blog of the same name which answers unusual science questions from readers in a light-hearted but scientifically grounded way. The What If column on the site is updated with new articles from time to time. His 2015 book <i>Thing Explainer</i> was based on comic  1133 (&quot;Up Goer Five&quot;) and explains scientific concepts using only the one thousand most commonly used words in English.</p>





<p>As a student, Munroe often drew charts, maps, and &quot;stick figure battles&quot; in the margins of his school notebooks, besides solving mathematical problems unrelated to his classes. By the time he graduated from university, Munroe&apos;s &quot;piles of notebooks&quot; became too large and he started scanning the images.</p>
<p><i>xkcd</i> began in September 2005, when Munroe decided to scan his doodles and put them on his personal website. According to Munroe, the comic&apos;s name has no particular significance and is simply a four-letter word without a phonetic pronunciation, something he describes as &quot;a treasured and carefully guarded point in the space of four-character strings.&quot; In January 2006, the comic was split off into its own website, created in collaboration with Derek Radtke.</p>
<p>In May 2007, the comic garnered widespread attention by depicting online communities in geographic form. Various websites were drawn as continents, each sized according to their relative popularity and located according to their general subject matter. This put <i>xkcd</i> at number two on the Syracuse Post-Standard&apos;s &quot;The new hotness&quot; list. By 2008, <i>xkcd</i> was able to financially support Munroe and Radtke &quot;reasonably well&quot; through the sale of multiple thousand T-shirts per month.</p>
<p>On September 19, 2012, comic  1110 &#x2013; &quot;Click and Drag&quot; featured a panel which can be explored via clicking and dragging its insides. It immediately triggered positive response on social websites and forums. The large image nested in the panel measures 165,888 pixels wide by 79,822 pixels high. Munroe later described it as &quot;probably the most popular one I ever put on the Internet,&quot; as well as placing it among his own favorites.</p>
<p>Comic  1190 &#x2013; &quot;Time&quot; began publication at midnight EDT on March 25, 2013, with the comic&apos;s image updating every 30 minutes until March 30, when they began to change every hour, lasting for over four months. The images constitute time lapse frames of a story, with the mouseover text originally reading &quot;Wait for it.&quot;, later changed to &quot;RUN.&quot; and changed again to &quot;The end.&quot; on July 26. The story began with a male and female character building a sandcastle complex on a beach who then embark on an adventure to learn the secrets of the sea. On July 26, the comic superimposed a frame (3094) with the phrase &quot;The End&quot;. Tasha Robinson of <i>The A.V. Club</i> wrote of the comic: &quot;[...] the kind of nifty experiment that keeps people coming back to XKCD, which at its best isn&apos;t a strip comic so much as an idea factory and a shared experience&quot;. Cory Doctorow mentioned &quot;Time&quot; in a brief article on <i>Boing Boing</i> on April 7, saying the comic was &quot;coming along nicely&quot;. The 3,099-panel &quot;Time&quot; comic ended on July 26, 2013, and was followed by a blog post summarizing the journey.</p>


<p>Munroe has been a fan of newspaper comic strips since childhood, describing <i>xkcd</i> as an &quot;heir&quot; to Charles M. Schulz&apos; <i>Peanuts</i>. Despite this influence, <i>xkcd</i>s quirky and technical humor would have been difficult to syndicate in newspapers. In webcomics, Munroe has said that &quot;one can draw something that appeals to 1 percent of the audience &#x2014; 1 percent of United States, that is three million people, that is more readers than small cartoons can have.&quot; Munroe cited the lack of a need for editorial control due to the low bar of access to the Internet as &quot;a salvation&quot;.</p>


<p>While there is no specific storyline to the webcomic, there are some recurring themes and characters. Recurring themes of <i>xkcd</i> include &quot;technology, science, mathematics and relationships.&quot; <i>xkcd</i> frequently features jokes related to popular culture, such as <i>Guitar Hero</i>, Facebook, Vanilla Ice, and Wikipedia.</p>
<p>There are many strips opening with the words &quot;My Hobby:&quot;, usually depicting the nondescript narrator character describing some type of humorous or quirky behavior. However, not all strips are intended to be humorous: <i>xkcd</i> frequently depicts romance and relationships, and other strips depict complex landscape drawings. <i>xkcd</i> frequently makes reference to Munroe&apos;s &quot;obsession&quot; with potential velociraptor attacks.</p>
<p>References to Wikipedia articles or to Wikipedia as a whole have occurred several times in <i>xkcd</i>. A facsimile of a made-up Wikipedia entry for &quot;malamanteau&quot; (a stunt word created by Munroe to poke fun at Wikipedia&apos;s writing style) provoked a controversy within Wikipedia that was picked up by various media.</p>
<p>Nearly every <i>xkcd</i> strip has a tooltip (specified using the  attribute in HTML), the text of which usually contains a secondary punchline or annotation related to that day&apos;s comic.</p>
<p>The unaffiliated site <i>explain xkcd</i> provides explanations of the science, technology and general knowledge involved in the jokes. The editors at <i>explain xkcd</i> have given unofficial invented names to the recurring characters.</p>


<p>On several occasions, fans have been motivated by Munroe&apos;s comics to carry out, in real life, the subject of a particular drawing or sketch. Some notable examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Richard Stallman was confronted by students dressed as ninjas before speaking at the Yale Political Union &#x2013; inspired by &quot;Open Source&quot;.</li>
<li>On September 23, 2007, hundreds of people gathered at Reverend Thomas J. Williams Park, , in North Cambridge, Massachusetts, whose coordinates were mentioned in &quot;Dream Girl&quot;. Munroe appeared, commenting, &quot;Maybe wanting something does make it real,&quot; reversing the conclusion he drew in the last frame of the same strip. This park is recognized by NASA&apos;s Spot The Station program, which provides information on viewing opportunities for the International Space Station.</li>
<li>When <i>xkcd</i> strip &quot;Time&quot; won a Hugo award in the &quot;Best Graphic Story&quot; category in August 2014, it was accepted by Cory Doctorow on behalf of Munroe, dressing as Munroe had drawn him in an earlier strip, &quot;1337: Part 5&quot;.</li>
<li><i>xkcd</i> readers began sneaking chess boards onto roller coasters after &quot;Chess Photo&quot; was published. &#x2013; inspired by &quot;Chess Photo&quot;.</li>
<li>The game of &quot;geohashing&quot; has gained more than 1,000 players, who travel to random coordinates calculated by the algorithm described in &quot;Geohashing&quot;.</li>
<li>In October 2007, a group of researchers at University of Southern California Information Sciences Institute conducted a census of the Internet and presented their data using a Hilbert curve, which they claimed was inspired by an <i>xkcd</i> comic that used a similar technique. Inspired by the same comic, the Carna Botnet used a Hilbert curve to present data in their 2012 Internet Census.</li>
<li>Based on &quot;Packages&quot;, programmers have set up programs to automatically find an item for sale on the Internet for $1.00 every day.</li>
<li>In response to &quot;Password Strength&quot;, Dropbox shows two messages reading &quot;lol&quot; and &quot;Whoa there, don&apos;t take advice from a webcomic too literally&#xA0;;)&quot; when attempting to register with the password &quot;correcthorsebatterystaple&quot;. ArenaNet recommended that <i>Guild Wars 2</i> users create passwords following the guidelines of the same comic.</li>
<li>Inspired by the xkcd comic &quot;Online Communities 2&quot;, Slovak artist Martin Vargic created the &quot;Map of the Internet 1.0.&quot;, which was subsequently featured in media worldwide.</li>
<li>In 2008, Munroe posted a parody of the Discovery Channel&apos;s <i>I Love the World</i> advertising campaign on <i>xkcd</i>, which was later reenacted by Neil Gaiman, Wil Wheaton, and Cory Doctorow.</li>
