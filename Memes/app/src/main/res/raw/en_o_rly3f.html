<h1>O RLY?</h1>

<p><b>O RLY?</b> is an Internet phenomenon, typically presented as an image macro featuring a snowy owl. The phrase &quot;O RLY?&quot;, an abbreviated form of &quot;Oh, really?&quot;, is popularly used in Internet forums in a sarcastic manner, often in response to an obvious, predictable, or blatantly false statement. Similar owl image macros followed the original to present different views, including images with the phrases &quot;YA RLY&quot; (Yeah, really.) and &quot;NO WAI!!&quot; (No way!).</p>





<p>Outside of Internet forums, O RLY? has been referenced in various video games, including <i>World of Warcraft</i> in which the auctioneer characters O&#x2019;Reely and Yarly are a reference to &quot;O RLY?&quot; and &quot;YA RLY!&quot;, respectively.</p>

<p>In 2006, anti-virus company Sophos discovered a computer worm known as &quot;W32/Hoots-A&quot;, which sends a graphical image of a snowy owl with the letters &quot;O RLY?&quot; to a print queue when it infects a Windows-based computer. A Sophos spokesman said that it appeared that the virus, written in Visual Basic, was not written by a professional, but that: &quot;it appears this malware was written for a specific organization, by someone who had inside knowledge of their IT infrastructure.&quot;</p>
