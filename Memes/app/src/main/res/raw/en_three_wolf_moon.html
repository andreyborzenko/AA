<h1>Three Wolf Moon</h1>
<p><b>Three Wolf Moon</b> is a T-shirt featuring three wolves howling at the moon. The numerous satirical reviews for this on Amazon.com have become an Internet phenomenon. The T-shirt was designed by artist Antonia Neshev.</p>







<p>The Three Wolf Moon T-shirt gained popularity after attracting sarcastic reviews on  attributing great power to it such as being irresistible to women, striking fear into other males and having magical healing abilities. These reviews were made mainly by members of the Bodybuilding.com Misc section. Brian Govern, a law student at Rutgers University, was searching for a school book on Amazon and was led to The Three Wolf Moon T-shirt by an Amazon recommendation which had been targeted at students purchasing college semester books. He decided to write a review of the shirt on a whim as he did not actually own the shirt. His faux-serious review as &quot;Bee-Dot-Govern&quot; in November 2008 concluded:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>: Fits my girthy frame, has wolves on it, attracts women</p>
<p>: Only 3 wolves (could probably use a few more on the &apos;guns&apos;), cannot see wolves when sitting with arms crossed, wolves would have been better if they glowed in the dark.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since this original review was posted, more than 2300 similar reviews have been posted. Some reviewers have uploaded images showing famous people wearing the shirt.</p>
<p>The shirt attracted further interest when it became viral on networking sites such as Digg and Facebook and was then lauded in conventional media as an Internet phenomenon. German scholar Melvin Haack considers it to be a notable example of a redneck joke. The reviews have been included in studies of such online sarcasm. Such sarcasm tends to confound analysis of customer reviews and so the texts have been analysed to determine which elements might identify sarcasm. One common example found in n-gram analysis was &quot;alpha male&quot;.</p>

<p>The T-shirt is manufactured by The Mountain Corporation, a wholesale clothing company in Keene, New Hampshire, United States. Their art director, Michael McGloin, said that they were making many more shirts in response to the great demand which had made it the top selling item in Amazon&apos;s clothing store. Due to the success of the shirt, the New Hampshire Division of Economic Development made it their &quot;official New Hampshire T-shirt of economic development&quot; and awarded it as a prize for innovation.</p>
