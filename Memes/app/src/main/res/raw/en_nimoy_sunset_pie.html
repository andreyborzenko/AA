<p><i>Blastr</i>s Scott Edelman was baffled by the website stating &quot;We&apos;re not sure that a website has ever baffled us and made us hungry at the same time before, but there&apos;s a first time for everything, we guess.&quot; Lawrence, Kansas website <i>Lawrence.com</i>s Gavon Laessig critiqued the previous Tumblr Selleck Waterfall Sandwich with &quot;The only thing really holding back [it] is the very rigid format,&quot; but commended Nimoy Sunset Pie with &quot;possibilities are limitless (for about another week&#x2026;so enjoy it now before it hits the wall.&quot; <i>BuzzFeed</i>s MelissBuzzFeed was similarly confused with &quot;Finally, a website that baffles me and makes me hungry at the same time.&quot; San Antonio, Texas daily newspaper <i>San Antonio Express-News</i>s Ren&#xE9; A. Guzman favored the meme with &quot;It ain&#x2019;t the Picard facepalm, but it&#x2019;s still pretty darn tasty.&quot;</p>
<p>Intel&apos;s Tiffany Peery called the meme &quot;awesome.&quot; <i>Discover</i>s Phil Plait praised the meme with &quot;This is without doubt the single greatest thing on Earth, and the very reason the Internet was invented.&quot; <i>The Village Voice</i>s Mackenzie Schmidt compared Nimoy Sunset Pie with Selleck Waterfall Sandwich as &quot;possibly more dimwitted (read: amazing) [...] Like its memebling brethren, the phenomenon is completely reliant on some sometimes brilliant, but mostly questionable Photoshopping skills, and enlightening captions.&quot; <i>Jezebel</i>s Hortense Smith reviewed the website favorably with &quot;If the creators of Nimoy Sunset Pie are to be believed, the secret of living long and prospering just might be...pie?!&quot;</p>
