<p>His fame came from one viral video named: &quot;Ottoman Steak&quot;, which was posted on the 7th of January, 2017 with his restaurant Twitter account Nusret. It was viewed 10 million times on Instagram after which he was dubbed &quot;Salt Bae&quot; because of his iconic sprinkle of salt. He was later interviewed by NBC News, where he said &quot;The shape of the meat and the taste of it starting from the top down is a part of me... All of my feelings are coming from inside of the meat down to when I put the salt onto the meat.&quot;</p>
