<h1>Harlem Shake (meme)</h1>

<p>The <b>Harlem Shake</b> is an Internet meme in the form of a video in which a group of people perform a comedy sketch accompanied by a short excerpt from the song &quot;Harlem Shake&quot;. As a meme, the video was replicated by many people, using the same concept, which led to it becoming viral in early February 2013, with thousands of &quot;Harlem Shake&quot; videos being made and uploaded to YouTube every day at the height of its popularity.</p>
<p>Despite its name, the meme does not actually involve participants performing the original Harlem Shake dance, a street and hip hop dance that originated in 1980s Harlem, New York City; rather, the meme usually features participants performing flailing or convulsive movements. The meme form was established in a video uploaded on January 30, 2013 by YouTube personality Filthy Frank. The video featured the character &quot;Pink Guy&quot; from <i>The Filthy Frank Show</i>, to the channel DizastaMusic, entitled &quot;FILTHY COMPILATION #6 - SMELL MY FINGERS&quot;, which featured a section where several costumed people danced to the song &quot;Harlem Shake&quot; by Baauer. The video opens with the first use of the Harlem Shake meme. The video was then parodied in another video made by five teenagers from Queensland, Australia known on YouTube as The Sunny Coast Skate. This video started a viral trend of people uploading their own &quot;Harlem Shake&quot; videos to YouTube.</p>




<p>The videos usually last about 30 seconds and features an excerpt of the 2012 song &quot;Harlem Shake&quot; by American electronic musician Baauer. Baauer&apos;s song starts with a 15-second intro, a bass drop, then 15 seconds with the bass, and a lion roar at the end of the first 30 seconds. Usually, a video begins with one person (often helmeted or masked) dancing to the song alone for 15 seconds, surrounded by other people not paying attention or seemingly unaware of the dancing individual. When the bass drops, the video cuts to the entire crowd doing a crazy convulsive dance for the rest of the video. The dancing style should not be confused with the original Harlem Shake dance. Additionally, in the second half of the video, people often wear either a minimum of clothes or crazy outfits or costumes while wielding strange props. Typically, but not always, the video will end by converting to slow motion on the feline growl.</p>

<p>This success of the videos was in part attributed to the anticipation of the breakout moment and short length, making them very accessible to watch. <i>The Washington Post</i> explained the meme&apos;s instant virality by referring to the jump cuts, hypnotic beat, quick setups, and half minute routines.</p>
<p>The Harlem Shake is technically very easy for fans to reproduce, as it consists of a single locked camera shot and one jump cut. Nonetheless, the simplicity of the concept allows fans considerable scope in creating their own distinctive variant and making their mark, while retaining the basic elements. In its simplest form, it could be made with just one person; a more sophisticated version might even involve a crowded stadium. Moreover, there is a level playing field for celebrities and fans alike, with no guarantee of success for either group. There is a strong vein of humour running through each video that is not dependent on language, further increasing its potential to spread virally.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Creation">Creation</span></h3>
<p>The &quot;Harlem Shake&quot; was first featured as the opening segment in a video by George Miller under the moniker of YouTube user &quot;DizastaMusic&quot;. Five teenagers from Australia, using the name TheSunnyCoastSkate, replicated this segment in their own video, which quickly gained popularity. As more people replicated the original video and uploaded their own versions to YouTube, Harlem Shake rapidly became an Internet meme.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Viral_spread">Viral spread</span></h3>


<p>On February 10, 2013, the upload rate of Harlem Shake videos reached 4,000 per day, or one every 21.6 seconds. As of February 11, about 12,000 versions of the popular Internet meme had been uploaded to YouTube, garnering over 44 million unique views. By February 15, about 40,000 Harlem Shake spinoff videos had been uploaded, generating over 700 millions views.</p>
<p>Harlem Shake hit the 1 billion view mark on March 24, 2013, just 40 days after its first upload, according to Visible Measures. From the day when the first video was uploaded until it hit 1 billion views, the videos were accumulating an average of more than 20 million views a day. The time it took for Harlem Shake to hit 1 billion views is half the time &quot;Gangnam Style&quot; took to hit 1 billion views and almost a sixth of the time that it took &quot;Call Me Maybe&quot;. On April 4, Harlem Shake had 1.21 billion views.</p>
<p>Baauer&apos;s single reached #1 on the iTunes America chart and #2 on iTunes in the UK and Australia on February 15, 2013.</p>
<p>Its popularity has spread in many countries, including the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, Russia, and much of Europe, China, India, Latin America, the United Arab Emirates, and Jamaica.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Legacy">Legacy</span></h3>
<p>The unexpected success of Harlem Shake caused <i>Billboard</i> to bring forward its plans, following two years of discussions, to incorporate data on YouTube views as one of three metrics used to calculate the influential Billboard Hot 100 chart. This marked an important recognition that YouTube now plays a vital role in shaping cultural trends, defining hit songs ahead of radio programmers.</p>
<p>In consequence of this significant change, Baauer&apos;s Harlem Shake made its debut at No. 1 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 on February 21, 2013. Without the change the song would only have debuted in the Top 15.</p>
<p>The success of Harlem Shake also highlights a change of direction for music rights holders. With the exception of a takedown notice issued when artist Azealia Banks tried to upload her own version of the track, Baauer and his label, Mad Decent records, instead made use of YouTube&apos;s Content ID database to assert copyright over the fan-made videos and claim a proportion of advertising revenue in respect of each one.</p>
<p>Gangnam Style, like other videos that preceded it, was a corporate, top-down traditional campaign. By contrast, the grassroots, bottom-up Harlem Shake has been described as a symbiotic viral meme, where open culture and business coexist. The short length of the video, 31 seconds in most cases, impacts directly on the duration of advertisement that can precede it, which in turn limits advertising revenue.</p>
<p>In addition, the comparatively short life cycle of this kind of video meme means that by the time a traditional advertising agency or brand has put together its response to a current trend, it is likely that the trend will have long since peaked.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Initial_response">Initial response</span></h3>
<p>Numerous commenters have compared the Harlem Shake to &quot;Gangnam Style&quot;. But the business magazine <i>Forbes</i> pointed out that unlike &quot;Gangnam Style&quot; and other notable hits from 2012, Harlem Shake is more of a meme, since a wide variety of groups and individuals have uploaded variants of the dance.</p>
<p>Martin Talbot, Managing Director of <i>The Official Charts Company</i> in the UK, described &quot;Harlem Shake&quot; as a &quot;phenomenon&quot;, the first ever &quot;crowd sourced video&quot; to significantly drive sales of a song. Previously, as happened with &quot;Gangnam Style&quot;, there was always an initial video created by an artist which would start a dance craze that was subsequently adopted by fans.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Harlem.27s_reaction">Harlem&apos;s reaction</span></h3>
<p>There were reports that Harlem residents were upset because of the dance called &quot;Harlem shake&quot; in the meme videos not being the real Harlem shake. Many felt that people in the videos were &quot;disrespecting&quot; the real dance and making the whole neighborhood of Harlem &quot;look bad&quot;. On the other hand, some Harlem shake dancers expressed the hopes of the Harlem shake dance making a comeback, becoming popular all over again as a result of the sudden exposure it got.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Projected_lifespan">Projected lifespan</span></h3>
<p><i>The Atlantic</i> magazine declared the &quot;meme murder[ed]&quot; when the mainstream Today television program broadcast their version of the Harlem Shake on February 13.</p>
<p><i>The Los Angeles Times</i> cited a number of reasons why it felt the meme was nearing its peak, including what it described as an &quot;extravagant&quot; departure from the meme&apos;s humble origins, adoption by a very broad demographic including the elderly, choreographed corporate versions by ad agencies and marketing departments, apparent boredom of video participants, and significant departures from the original formula, such as the use of multiple camera angles and visual effects.</p>
<p>After numerous companies and startups began uploading their own Harlem Shake videos for what appeared to be promotional purposes, the business magazine <i>Forbes</i> advised them to produce their own original content instead of variants of the same video. It stated that there were too many versions already on YouTube, and that such publicity efforts could become &quot;lost amidst all the noise.&quot;</p>
<p>Similarly, <i>Ad Age</i> begged advertising agencies not to &quot;attempt to surf on the now-crashed viral wave.&quot; <i>Ad Age</i> later identified sixty advertising agencies exploiting the meme, calling it &quot;played-out&quot; after Pepsico released a Harlem Shake video featuring dancing soft drinks. Gabrielle Levy of UPI called the Pepsi ad &quot;a bridge too far,&quot; noting that low production values had been &quot;part of the charm&quot; of the meme. <i>Time</i> asked, &quot;do you really want to open a can of soda after it&#x2019;s done the Harlem Shake?&quot;</p>

The students and team players were flying for a tournament in San Diego. After the video was uploaded on February 15, 2013, it gained media attention, causing the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to launch an investigation. Three of the college students, who organized the event, said in an interview that the flight attendants and the purser approved their permission before the performance began, saying it was a great idea and the participating passengers also found it fun. The case was finally solved when a spokesperson for the airline said that &quot;all safety measures were strictly enforced and followed and that the seat belt sign was turned off during the course of filming&quot;.</p>
