<h1>Little Superstar</h1>
<p><b>Little Superstar</b> is a video uploaded on YouTube, which is a clip from the 1990 Indian film <i>Adhisaya Piravi</i>, starring Rajinikanth. The clip features the dwarf South Indian actor King Kong (not to be confused with Thavakalai, another Indian little person actor) breakdancing to MC Miker G &amp; DJ Sven&apos;s &quot;Holiday Rap&quot;. Various mashups have also appeared on the Internet using tracks from Cypress Hill, Michael Jackson and others, including Ted&apos;s Fear Factory video. The first site to feature little superstar, and give the clip its name was Dorks.com.</p>
<p>The video has been featured on YouTube, in Tom Anderson&apos;s bulletins on Myspace, on the E! TV show The Soup, the MSNBC shows Countdown with Keith Olbermann and Tucker Carlson, G4TV&apos;s Attack of the Show! and elsewhere, as well as having been parodied on Saturday Night Live. Another popular video clip features King Kong slapping a man from the same movie.</p>
<p>In recent years, actor King Kong has choreographed a dance number in a <i>Doritos Tandoori Sizzler!</i> commercial shown in Canada, which was filmed in India.</p>

<p><i>Mother:</i> Hey, hey. What&apos;s with the party early morning? Get out everybody, shoo, shoo. [<i>Speaking to Rajinikanth, who&apos;s lying on the cot</i>] Why not take some rest, dear?</p>
<p><i>Rajinikanth:</i> OK Mom [<i>lights up a beedi as she walks away</i>].</p>

<p><i>Rajinikanth:</i> Hey! Kids shouldn&apos;t smoke.</p>
<p><i>Kingkong:</i> Buddy, I&apos;m ten years older than you. Give it to me I say.</p>
<p><i>Rajinikanth:</i> And if I don&apos;t?</p>
<p><i>Kingkong:</i> I&apos;ll skin you alive.</p>
<p><i>Rajinikanth:</i> Here you go</p>

<p><i>Kingkong:</i> Brother, you don&apos;t worry about this silly duel. I&apos;ll take care of this myself (with my hands).</p>
<p><i>Rajinikanth:</i> Ok.</p>
<p>(Kingkong slaps thug)</p>
<p><i>Kingkong:</i> [<i>pauses and looks at Rajinikant</i>] Dude, how (am I doing)?</p>
<p><i>Rajinikanth:</i> Great!</p>
<p><i>Rajinikanth:</i> Enough. He&apos;s going to die!</p>
<p>[<i>Kingkong returns back to cot</i>]</p>
<p><i>Rajinikanth:</i> Well, is this enough or do you want a piece of me too?</p>

<p>The clips were incorrectly reported as being from Bollywood, which predominantly refers to the filmmaking industry of Hindi films, in some places on the web and TV media, such as YouTube, Yahoo and the &quot;Oddball Plays of the Month&quot; segment of Keith Olbermann show on MSNBC. The film is actually from Tamil cinema, colloquially known as <i>Kollywood</i>, the Tamil filmmaking industry based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.</p>
<p>King Kong has been incorrectly described as a child actor in some places. He is actually an adult with dwarfism. He was also never known as a &quot;little superstar&quot; in the Tamil film industry and is only the phenomenal title of the clip given by its uploaders.</p>

<p>A parody version of &quot;Little Superstar&quot; starring porn star Ron Jeremy first started turning up on video sharing websites in March 2007. Another parody starring Fred Armisen as Kingkong and Bill Hader as Rajinikanth aired on Saturday Night Live on April 21, 2007. Nobody&apos;s Watching also created a parody of the video. A parody of &quot;Little Superstar&quot; appeared in the season finale Gorillas in the Mist (American Dad!) of the sixth season of <i>American Dad!</i>.</p>
