<h1>Vaporwave</h1>



<p><b>Vaporwave</b> (British English: <b>vapourwave</b>) is an electronic music subgenre and art movement that originated in the early 2010s and spread over the next half of the decade among various Internet communities. It is characterized by a nostalgic or surrealist fascination with entertainment, technology and advertising of the 1980s and 1990s, and styles of both corporate and popular music such as lounge music, smooth jazz and elevator music. Vaporwave music is interpreted as a critique or reflection on consumer capitalism and popular culture. Its name alludes to vaporware, a term for products, typically computer software or hardware, which are announced but never released.</p>
<p>The visual style of vaporwave (as seen on album covers and music videos) is commonly referred to as <i>aesthetics</i> (often stylized as &quot;&quot;, with fullwidth characters). The style often involves classical sculpture, web design, surrealism, low-poly computer renderings, glitch art, VHS recordings, cassette tapes, Japanese art and cyberpunk tropes.</p>




<p>Vaporwave originated as an Internet-birthed style loosely derived from the work of hypnagogic pop artists such as Ariel Pink and James Ferraro. Daniel Lopatin&apos;s 2010 release <i>Chuck Person&apos;s Eccojams Vol. 1</i>, Ferraro&apos;s <i>Far Side Virtual</i> and Vektroid&apos;s <i>Floral Shoppe</i> (released under the alias &quot;Macintosh Plus&quot;) are often credited for sparking the beginning and development of the trend, as well as solidifying it as a genre. Vaporwave found wider appeal in 2012, with the release of Blank Banshee&apos;s debut album <i>Blank Banshee 0</i>, which introduced his signature fusion style of vaporwave&apos;s sampling techniques and trap music known as vaportrap. Saint Pepsi&apos;s 2013 album <i>Hit Vibes</i> pioneered the futurefunk subgenre.</p>
<p>A 2015 <i>Rolling Stone</i> list included vaporwave act 2814 as one of &quot;10 artists you need to know&quot;, citing their album <i>Atarashii Hi no Tanj&#x14D;</i> . That same year, the album <i>I&apos;ll Try Living Like This</i> by Death&apos;s Dynamic Shroud.wmv was featured at number fifteen on the <i>Fact</i> list &quot;The 50 Best Albums of 2015&quot;.</p>
<p>In 2015, MTV International introduced a rebrand heavily inspired by vaporwave and seapunk. On that same day, Tumblr launched a GIF viewer named Tumblr TV, with an explicitly MTV-styled visual spin.</p>

<p>Vaporwave has been interpreted as &quot;a degrading of commercial music&quot; in an attempt to &quot;reveal the false promises of capitalism&quot;. Music writer Adam Harper of <i>Dummy Mag</i> describes vaporwave as &quot;ironic and satirical or truly accelerationist&quot;, noting that the name itself was both a nod to vaporware, a name for products that are introduced but never released, and the idea of libidinal energy being subjected to relentless sublimation under capitalism.</p>
<p>Critic Simon Reynolds has characterized Daniel Lopatin&apos;s Chuck Person project as &quot;relat[ing] to cultural memory and the buried utopianism within capitalist commodities, especially those related to consumer technology in the computing and audio/video entertainment area&quot;. <i></i> , an alias of Vektroid, describes her 2012 album <i>Sapporo Contemporary</i>  as &quot;a brief glimpse into the new possibilities of international communication&quot; and &quot;a parody of American hypercontextualization of e-Asia circa 1995&quot;.</p>
<p>Music educator Grafton Tanner wrote in his 2016 book <i>Babbling Corpse: Vaporwave and the Commodification of Ghosts</i>, &quot;vaporwave is one artistic style that seeks to rearrange our relationship with electronic media by forcing us to recognize the unfamiliarity of ubiquitous technology.&quot; He later wrote, &quot;vaporwave is the music of &apos;non-times&apos; and &apos;non-places&apos; because it is skeptical of what consumer culture has done to time and space&quot;. In his review of <i>Hologram Plaza</i> by Disconscious, an album of the mallsoft subgenre of vaporwave, Dylan Kilby of Sunbleach Media stated that &quot;[t]he origins of mallsoft lie in the earliest explorations of vaporwave, where the concept of malls as large, soulless spaces of consumerism were evoked in some practitioner&apos;s utilization of vaporwave as a means for exploring the social ramifications of capitalism and globalization&quot;, and said that such an approach &quot;has largely petered out in the last few years in favor of pure sonic exploration/expression&quot;.</p>
<p>Speaking on the adoption of a vaporwave and seapunk-inspired rebrand by MTV International, Jordan Pearson of <i>Motherboard</i>, <i>Vice</i> technology website, noted how &quot;the cynical impulse that animated vaporwave and its associated Tumblr-based aesthetics is co-opted and erased on both sides&#x2014;where its source material originates and where it lives&quot;.</p>


<p><b>Simpsonwave</b> is a YouTube phenomenon made popular by the user Lucien Hughes. It mainly consists of videos with scenes from the American animated television series <i>The Simpsons</i> set to various vaporwave songs. Clips are often edited with VHS-esque distortion effects and purple video filters, giving them a &quot;hallucinatory and transportive&quot; feel.</p>
<p><b>Fashwave</b> (a portmanteau of &quot;fascist&quot; and &quot;vaporwave&quot;), is a largely instrumental subgenre, with political track titles and occasional soundbites. In January 2017, <i>Vice</i> Penn Bullock and Eli Penn reported on the phenomenon of self-identified fascists and alt-right members appropriating vaporwave music and aesthetics, describing fashwave as &quot;the first fascist music that is easy enough on the ears to have mainstream appeal.&quot; One off-shoot, <b>Trumpwave</b>, focuses on Donald Trump. <i>Vice</i> writes that Trumpwave exploits vaporwave&apos;s ambivalence towards the corporate culture it engages with, allowing it to recast Trump as &quot;the modern-day inheritor of the mythologized 80s, a decade that is taken to stand for racial purity and unleashed capitalism.&quot;</p>
