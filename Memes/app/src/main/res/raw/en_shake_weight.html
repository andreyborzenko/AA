<p>The Shake Weight has a female and male version, though it was initially released as a product &quot;designed specifically for women&quot;.</p>
<p>The female version weighs 2.5&#xA0;lb. Per official company press releases, &quot;Based on a groundbreaking workout technology called Dynamic Inertia, which engages the muscles in the arms, shoulders and chest in an entirely new fashion, the Shake Weight increases upper body muscle activity by more than 300% compared to traditional free weights&quot;. The company website further adds that the product has &quot;scientifically proven results&quot; and that the user can &quot;get incredible results in just six minutes a day, three hundred sixty-five days a year&quot;. In comparison, the male version weighs twice as much at 5&#xA0;lb.</p>
<p>The product appears to be based on &quot;vibration plate technology&#x2014;machines that vibrate to make the muscles relax and contract several times a second&#x2014;thought to enhance the impact of exercise&quot;. The company claims this action tones the upper biceps, triceps and shoulders.</p>

<p>Shake Weight has gained popular attention and parody because its use involves pumping a phallic object.

Following its July 2009 debut, clips from a Shake Weight infomercial quickly went viral. The viral YouTube clip has more than 4,000,000 views.</p>
<p>Among its many appearances on television shows, Shake Weight was tested on <i>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</i>, and <i>This Morning</i>.

<p>A 2011 study in <i>Consumer Reports</i> states that for the chest, shoulder and triceps, the Shake Weight&apos;s exercises are inferior to conventional exercises that target the individual muscles. For the biceps, the results were similar. Additionally, the report found that the Shake Weight routines burned fewer calories than walking at 3 mph.</p>
