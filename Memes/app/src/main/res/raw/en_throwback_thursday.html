<h1>Throwback Thursday</h1>
<p><b>Throwback Thursday</b> is a trend among social media sites such as Instagram, Twitter and Facebook&apos;s wherein users post or repost older photographs (often from their childhood) with the hashtag #ThrowbackThursday or #TBT.</p>
<p><i>Sports Illustrated</i> attributes the origin of the term to a sneaker-specific blog named <i>Nice Kicks</i>. According to <i>SI</i>, this blog began a practice of regular postings (on Thursdays) of photos of old basketball footwear in 2006, titling the series &quot;Throwback Thursday&quot;.</p>
