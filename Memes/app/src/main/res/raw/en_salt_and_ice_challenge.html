<h1>Salt and ice challenge</h1>
<p>The <b>salt and ice challenge</b> is an Internet phenomenon wherein participants pour salt on their bodies, usually on the arm, and ice is then placed on the salt. This causes a &quot;burning&quot; sensation, and participants vie to withstand the pain for the longest time. The challenge can be recorded and posted on YouTube or other forms of social media.</p>
<p>The mixture of ice and salt creates a eutectic frigorific mixture which can get as cold as &#x2212;18&#xA0;&#xB0;C (0&#xA0;&#xB0;F), much colder than ice alone. This repeatable cooling reaction was used to calibrate the Fahrenheit temperature scale.</p>
<p>The salt and ice challenge can quickly cause second- and third-degree injuries similar to frostbite or burning yourself with the metal end of a lighter. Due to the numbing sensation of the cold and possible nerve damage during the stunt, participants are often unaware of the extent of any injuries sustained during the challenge. Skin discoloration from the challenge may remain after the challenge has been attempted.</p>
