<h1>Grumpy Cat</h1>


<p><b>Tardar Sauce</b> (born April 4, 2012), commonly known as <b>Grumpy Cat</b>, is a cat Internet and media personality and actress. She is known for her permanently &quot;grumpy&quot; facial appearance, which is caused by an underbite and feline dwarfism. She came to prominence when a photograph of her was posted on social news website Reddit by Bryan Bundesen, the brother of her owner Tabatha, in September 2012, and lolcats and parodies created from the photograph by Reddit users went viral. She is the subject of a popular internet meme in which negative lolcats (such as &quot;I Had Fun Once... It Was Awful&quot;) are made from photographs of her.</p>




<p>Tardar Sauce was one of a litter of four kittens born to a calico mother and a father of an unknown breed at the home of her owner, Tabatha Bundesen. The Bundesens say that Tardar Sauce&apos;s face appears grumpy because the feline has a form of dwarfism. She and her brother Pokey were born to normal parents with &quot;a flat face, bubble eyes, and a short tail&quot;. Tardar Sauce is undersized and has hind legs that &quot;are a bit different&quot;. Although she has a &quot;grumpy&quot; appearance and is called &quot;Grumpy Cat&quot;, according to the Bundesens, 99% of the time she is a &quot;normal kitty&quot;.</p>
<p>Ben Lashes is Grumpy Cat&apos;s manager who also represents Keyboard Cat and Nyan Cat. Tabatha Bundesen took a leave of absence from her day job at Red Lobster to manage Grumpy Cat&apos;s schedule while Bryan Bundesen manages the Grumpy Cat website, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter accounts.</p>
