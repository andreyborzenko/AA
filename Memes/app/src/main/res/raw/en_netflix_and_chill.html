<h1>Netflix and chill</h1>
<p><b>Netflix and chill</b> is an English-language general term using an invitation to watch Netflix together as a euphemism for sex, either between partners or casually as a booty call. Since its first recorded, non-sexual use in a tweet posted in 2009, the term has gained popularity within the Twitter community and other social media sites such as Facebook and Vine. By 2015, <i>Netflix and chill</i> had become an internet meme, with its use in teenage social media described as &quot;sexual&quot; by <i>Fusion</i>. Much like <i>selfie</i>, use of the term has now spread beyond the internet and into general common use.</p>

<p>The first recorded use of the phrase &quot;Netflix and chill&quot; was in a tweet posted by &quot;NoFaceNina&quot; in January 2009. Early use of the phrase was without sexual connotations, referring simply to the act of watching the online streaming service, typically by oneself. By 2013, Netflix&apos;s popularity in the US had risen greatly, having accumulated millions of paid subscribers, increasing verb use of the brand and this phrase as a standalone compound noun.</p>
<p>The euphemistic nature of the phrase is believed to have been established in mid-2014, and by the end of the year had spread throughout the African American Black Twitter community, as seen by many now typing <i>chill</i> within scare quotes. In April 2015, a definition of the phrase was added to Urban Dictionary stating that it meant &quot;code for two people going to each other&apos;s houses and [have sexual intercourse] or doing other sexual related acts&quot;. Soon, the term would spread beyond Black Twitter, becoming an internet meme, gaining the attention of news websites such as <i>The Guardian</i> and the <i>Daily Mirror</i>.</p>
<p>Among the jokes and image macros made by online users, many would feature the phrase &quot;20 minutes into Netflix and chill&quot;, coupled with a reaction image suggesting the true ulterior motive.</p>

<p>As the phrase entered into common lexicon, events, products, and services associated with the phrase&#x2014;including condoms&#x2014;started to emerge, and acknowledgement from Netflix itself appeared.</p>
<p>In September 2015, a joke app in the style of Tinder had been created for users to organize &quot;Netflix and chill&quot; sessions. At two separate universities, students planned &quot;Netflix and chill&quot; festivals, with one being cancelled by authorities as they believed too many people would be in attendance. During the World Maker Faire in New York, Netflix unveiled a prototype for a large button called &quot;The Switch&quot;, which, when pressed, will dim the lights in the users&apos; residence, activate the &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; feature on their cell phones, and prepare Netflix for streaming&#x2014;eliminating most distractions from their activities. This has been frequently referred to as the &quot;Netflix and chill button&quot;.</p>
<p>In November 2015, the Netflix logo outside the company&apos;s headquarters in Los Gatos, California had been spray-painted to add the words &quot;and chill&quot;.</p>
<p>In January 2016, artist Tom Galle and company ART404 created a &quot;Netflix &amp; Chill Room&quot; in New York City for rent on Airbnb.</p>

The results were accompanied with a series of social media posts with the hashtag &quot;#DatingWithNetflix&quot; promoting the idea of a positive impact for couples using the service.</p>
<p>In June 2016, singer-songwriter Danah released a song titled &quot;Netflix and Chill&quot; on SoundCloud. The track was produced by Wippy Lion, a member of Australian pop group Justice Crew. The song is a tongue-in-cheek representation of the term&apos;s use in popular culture.</p>
