<h1>My Boo (Ghost Town DJ&apos;s song)</h1>
<p>&quot;<b>My Boo</b>&quot; is the only single released by the Atlanta-based hip hop group Ghost Town DJ&apos;s. It was released on Jermaine Dupri&apos;s So So Def label and Columbia Records, on the compilation album <i>So So Def Bass All-Stars</i>. The song, an invite by a female to a male, blends R&amp;B-style vocals over a hip hop beat. It was written by Carlton Mahone, Rodney Terry and Lil Jon, with lead vocals sung by Virgo Williams. The song peaked at #31 on the Billboard Hot 100 on its initial release in 1996. In 2016, the song was re-popularized by the &quot;Running Man Challenge&quot; and re-entered the Hot 100 giving it a new peak of #27 twenty years after its original release.</p>




<p>Virgo Williams was working on becoming a solo artist, and she was originally intended to provide background vocals for My Boo for another artist named Akema, but she was not able to work with the song, and it was decided that Williams&apos; version of the song was better and Williams&apos; vocals became the lead vocals. Lil Jon was an A&amp;R Director for So So Def at the time, and oversaw the production of the song. He was also the executive producer of the song, but could not take credit for the production because of his job position. Terry also produced it, and it was the second version of the beat currently used in the song.</p>

<p>The music video features a pool party. The group does not appear in the video.</p>

<p>&quot;My Boo&quot; entered the Billboard charts on the issue dated June 15, 1996 with its number 71 debut on the Hot R&amp;B Airplay chart, with early airplay concentrated at Southern R&amp;B radio stations. Three weeks later, following its commercial release as a vinyl 12-inch single, it entered the Hot R&amp;B Singles and Hot 100 charts at numbers 41 and 65, respectively. On the latter chart, where it was the highest-ranking debut of the week, nearly 85% of the single&apos;s chart points were derived from airplay, with its vinyl-only release precluding a larger contribution from sales. Though it was ultimately never released domestically in the more popular cassette and CD configurations, the single managed to peak at numbers 18 and 31 on Hot R&amp;B Singles and the Hot 100, respectively. The song was especially popular at rhythmic radio stations, peaking at number 2 on the Top 40/Rhythm-Crossover chart.</p>
<p>Nearly twenty years after the song&apos;s original chart run, a resurgence in its popularity driven by the Running Man Challenge viral meme prompted its re-entry on the charts dated May 21, 2016. On the strength of 35,000 digital download sales and 12.3 million domestic streams, &quot;My Boo&quot; re-entered the R&amp;B chart, which had long since been renamed Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, at number 14, and the Hot 100 at number 29, surpassing the single&apos;s initial peaks on both charts. It subsequently peaked at numbers 10 and 27, respectively.</p>

<p>In the 2004 song &quot;I Wanna Be Your Lady&quot; from Cam&apos;ron &amp; The Diplomats&apos; second album together on <i>Diplomatic Immunity 2</i>, the song was interpolated. In 2007, the song was interpolated on Pitbull and Lloyd&apos;s &quot;Secret Admirer&quot;. In 2009, the song was sampled in the So So Def Mix of &quot;H.A.T.E.U.&quot; by Mariah Carey. A slowed down witch house remix was released by Balam Acab in 2011. Interpolations of the song are featured in Ciara&apos;s 2013 single &quot;Body Party&quot;.</p>

<p>Brooklyn-based band Friends released a cover of &quot;My Boo&quot; as the B-side to their single &quot;I&apos;m His Girl&quot;, released on October 31, 2011. The Australian Producer Harley Streten (Flume) released a Cover of &quot;My Boo&quot; for the Triple J&#xB4;s Like a Version in Dec 1, 2016 and later this cover was released on Itunes in Dec 16,2016 .</p>

<p>In 2016, twenty years after its initial release, &quot;My Boo&quot; gained notoriety through the Running Man Challenge, a viral meme in which participants filmed and shared short clips of themselves performing a dance resembling running to the song. The original videos were posted on Vine by Kevin Vincent and Jeremiah Hall, high school students in Hillside, New Jersey. Inspired by Vincent and Hall&apos;s video, two players from the University of Maryland Terrapins college basketball program, Jared Nickens and Jaylen Brantley, filmed their own versions of the Running Man Challenge, spreading the meme.</p>
<p>The challenge went viral on Vine, and Vincent, Hall, Nickens and Brantley were invited to perform it on <i>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</i>. Many other athletes from various sports, a number of celebrities and the general public have embraced the trend and produced their own takes of the dance.</p>
